# Introduction

Linear quotients are orbit spaces of the action of a finite group $G$ on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ over $\mathbb C$.
Formally, we define $V/G := \operatorname{Spec}\mathbb C[V]^G$.
Notice that the invariant ring $\mathbb C[V]^G$ is an affine algebra by a theorem of Hilbert-Noether.
