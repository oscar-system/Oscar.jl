# [``G_4``-Fluxes](@id g4_fluxes)

In F-theory compactifications on Calabi--Yau 4-folds, **``G_4``-fluxes** are essential ingredients
for defining consistent and physically meaningful vacua. They affect various physical aspects, such
as the chiral spectrum in the 4D effective theory, tadpole cancellation, and moduli stabilization.
This page provides an accessible introduction to working with ``G_4``-fluxes in `FTheoryTools`, including
background, construction methods, and available functionality.

## Background: What Is a ``G_4``-Flux?

Let ``\widehat{Y}_4`` be a smooth Calabi--Yau 4-fold obtained via crepant resolution of a singular elliptically
fibered 4-fold ``Y_4 \to B_3``. A **``G_4``-flux** is a cohomology class:

$G_4 \in H^{2, 2}(\widehat{Y}_4, \mathbb{R}) \equiv H^{2, 2}(\widehat{Y}_4, \mathbb{C}) \cap H^4(\widehat{Y}_4, \mathbb{R})$

subject to **quantization**, **transversality**, and several additional consistency conditions:

1. **Quantization (cf. [Witten 1997](@cite Wit97)):** ``G_4 + \frac{1}{2} c_2(\widehat{Y}_4) \in H^4(\widehat{Y}_4, \mathbb{Z})``

2. **Transversality:** The flux must be orthogonal to both the base and the fiber in a precise cohomological sense.

3. Additional constraints, such as **D3-tadpole cancellation**, **self-duality**, and **primitivity**, are also typically imposed. One often requires that the ``G_4``-flux preserves the non-abelian gauge symmetry encoded in the fibration.

These conditions ensure compatibility with fundamental physical principles like anomaly cancellation and D3-brane
charge quantization.

For further theoretical background, see the exposition in [Weigand 2018](@cite Wei18).

## Modeling ``G_4``-Fluxes

In practice, `FTheoryTools` focuses on **candidate ``G_4``-fluxes**: elements of the rational cohomology group
``H^{2,2}(\widehat{Y}_4, \mathbb{Q})``, i.e.

$G_4 \in H^{2, 2}(\widehat{Y}_4, \mathbb{Q}) \equiv H^{2, 2}(\widehat{Y}_4, \mathbb{C}) \cap H^4(\widehat{Y}_4, \mathbb{Q})\,.$

We work with rational coefficients due to both the quantization condition---which implies that valid fluxes must
have rational coefficients---and the practical advantages this offers in computation. Currently, `FTheoryTools`
cannot fully verify the quantization condition, so we adopt the term **candidate flux**. We elaborate on our approach
to the quantization condition below.

The space ``H^{2,2}(\widehat{Y}_4, \mathbb{C})`` admits an orthogonal decomposition:

$H^{2, 2}(\widehat{Y}_4, \mathbb{C}) = H^{2, 2}_\text{hor}(\widehat{Y}_4, \mathbb{C}) \oplus H^{2, 2}_\text{vert}(\widehat{Y}_4, \mathbb{C}) \oplus H^{2, 2}_\text{rem}(\widehat{Y}_4, \mathbb{C})\,.$

- **Horizontal fluxes** arise from variations of the complex structure,
- **Vertical fluxes** are built from wedge products of (1,1)-forms,
- **Remainder fluxes** account for the rest.

`FTheoryTools` focuses on the **vertical part**.

### Standing Assumption

`FTheoryTools` assumes that ``\widehat{Y}_4`` is defined as a hypersurface in a complete, smooth toric variety
``X_\Sigma``. (In principle, it would suffice for the hypersurface to be smooth and the ambient space to be simplicial.
However, we compute characteristic classes of the ambient space and restrict them to the hypersurface to obtain
``c_2(\widehat{Y}_4)``, and this requires the ambient space to be smooth.)

### Workflow

Under this assumption, we can access a subspace of the vertical cohomology:

$\left. H^{2,2}(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q}) \right|_{\widehat{Y}_4} \subseteq H^{2,2}_{\text{vert}}(\widehat{Y}_4, \mathbb{Q}) \,.$

We refer to elements in this subspace as **ambient vertical fluxes**.

Theorem 9.3.2 of [Cox, Little, Schenck 2011](@cite CLS11) states that for complete, simplicial toric varieties,
``H^{p, q}(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q}) = 0`` whenever ``p \ne q``. Consequently, ``H^{2, 2}(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q}) = H^4(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})``.
Furthermore, Theorem 12.4.1 of [Cox, Little, Schenck 2011](@cite CLS11) establishes that ``H^4(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})``
is isomorphic to ``R_{\mathbb{Q}}(\Sigma)_2``, the space of degree-2 monomials (under the standard grading) in
the cohomology ring ``R_{\mathbb{Q}}(\Sigma)`` of ``X_\Sigma``. This cohomology ring is the quotient of
``\mathbb{Q}[x_1, \dots, x_r]``, where ``r`` is the number of rays in the polyhedral fan ``\Sigma`` of the toric
ambient space ``X_\Sigma``, by the sum of the Stanley--Reisner ideal and the ideal of linear relations.

To construct a generating set of ambient candidate ``G_4``-fluxes, we proceed as follows:

1. Construct the cohomology ring ``R_{\mathbb{Q}}(\Sigma)``.
2. Identify a basis of degree-2 monomials in ``R_{\mathbb{Q}}(\Sigma)``.
3. Restrict these monomials to ``\widehat{Y}_4``.

While performing the restriction to ``\widehat{Y}_4``, dependencies may arise:

- Some monomials vanish identically,
- Others may become linearly dependent.

`FTheoryTools` currently detects *only obviously trivial* restrictions (e.g., cycles whose intersection
with ``\widehat{Y}_4`` is empty). It does **not** eliminate all possible dependencies---hence the result
is a **generating set**, not a minimal basis. This pragmatic choice enables efficient and scalable construction
of vertical flux candidates across a wide range of F-theory geometries.

`FTheoryTools` includes specialized algorithms to perform steps 1 through 3. These algorithms—described in
detail in the appendix of [BMT25](@cite BMT25)—are especially effective for large geometries such as those
studied in [Taylor, Wang 2015](@cite TW15), where traditional Gröbner basis techniques are computationally
impractical. Even for more manageable QSM geometries (cf. [Cvetič, Halverson, Ling, Liu, Tian 2019](@cite CHLLT19)),
we observe a significant performance boost.

### Necessary Conditions for Flux Quantization

Verifying the flux quantization condition (cf. [Witten 1997](@cite Wit97)) is generally difficult. In practice,
`FTheoryTools` performs necessary consistency checks to gather evidence for (or against) proper quantization.

Let ``H`` denote the hypersurface divisor class defining ``\widehat{Y}_4`` inside the ambient toric variety
``X_\Sigma``. Let ``\{D_i\}`` be a basis for the toric divisor classes of ``X_\Sigma``, and let
``\hat{c}_2 \in H^{2,2}(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})`` be a class whose restriction gives the second Chern class of
the Calabi--Yau hypersurface, i.e., ``\left. \hat{c}_2 \right|_{\widehat{Y}_4} = c_2(\widehat{Y}_4)``.

As elaborated above, in `FTheoryTools`, a ``G_4``-flux candidate is modeled by a class
``g \in H^{2,2}(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})``, and its restriction to ``\widehat{Y}_4`` defines the actual flux
candidate. A necessary condition for quantization of this flux ``G_4``—modelled by
``g \in H^{2,2}(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})``—is that, for all pairs of indices ``i``, ``j``, the following integral
evaluates to an integer:

$\int_{X_\Sigma}{\left(g + \frac{1}{2} \hat{c}_2 \right) \wedge [H] \wedge [D_i] \wedge [D_j]}\,,$

where $[D]$ indicates the Poincaré dual cohomology class to the divisor ``D``. It is these conditions that
we check in `FTheoryTools`.

Even these elementary checks can be computationally expensive on large geometries. Therefore, `FTheoryTools`
allows users to **skip quantization checks** during flux construction using the keyword argument `check = false`.
This can be useful in early-stage explorations or for performance optimization.

## Working with ``G_4``-Fluxes

### Constructing ``G_4``-Fluxes

In `FTheoryTools`, ``G_4``-fluxes are created from cohomology classes associated with a given resolved F-theory
model.

```@docs
g4_flux(model::AbstractFTheoryModel, class::CohomologyClass; check::Bool = true)
```

For the special class of quadrillion Standard models (QSMs) (cf. [Cvetič, Halverson, Ling, Liu, Tian 2019](@cite CHLLT19)),
the chosen flux can be obtained conveniently.

```@docs
qsm_flux(qsm_model::AbstractFTheoryModel)
```

### Attributes of ``G_4``-Fluxes

You can inspect a ``G_4``-flux using the following attributes:

```@docs
model(gf::G4Flux)
cohomology_class(gf::G4Flux)
d3_tadpole_constraint(gf::G4Flux)
```

### Properties of ``G_4``-Fluxes

You can check whether a ``G_4``-flux satisfies common physical constraints using:

```@docs
is_well_quantized(gf::G4Flux)
passes_transversality_checks(gf::G4Flux)
passes_tadpole_cancellation_check(gf::G4Flux)
breaks_non_abelian_gauge_group(gf::G4Flux)
```

## Working with Families of ``G_4``-Fluxes

In many F-theory applications, it is useful to study entire families of fluxes rather than individual ones.
`FTheoryTools` supports both the construction and analysis of such flux families.

### Constructing a Flux Family from Parametrization and Offset

You can construct a flux family explicitly by specifying its parametrization in terms of the ambient
``G_4``-flux generators:

```@docs
chosen_g4_flux_gens(m::AbstractFTheoryModel; check::Bool = true)
```

To define a flux family in this way, you must provide:

- **Integral coefficients**: Rational combinations of generators whose ``\mathbb{Z}``-span lies within the family,
- **Rational coefficients**: Rational combinations of generators forming the ``\mathbb{Q}``-span of the family,
- **Offset vector**: Typically representing the shift by ``\frac{1}{2} c_2(\widehat{Y}_4)`` from the quantization condition.

The constructor is:

```@docs
family_of_g4_fluxes(m::AbstractFTheoryModel, mat_int::QQMatrix, mat_rat::QQMatrix, offset::Vector{QQFieldElem}; check::Bool = true)
```

### Constructing a Flux Family Based on Physical Conditions

A common use case is to construct the family of all ``G_4``-fluxes satisfying key physical constraints:

- Passing the necessary quantization checks (as discussed earlier),
- Satisfying all transversality conditions,
- Optionally preserving the non-abelian gauge symmetry.

This method is less flexible than direct parametrization, but very convenient for typical model-building workflows.

!!! warning
    This operation may be computationally expensive for large or complex geometries.

```@docs
special_flux_family(m::AbstractFTheoryModel; not_breaking::Bool = false, check::Bool = true, algorithm::String = "default")
```

### Attributes of a Flux Family

You can access key data about a flux family using the following attributes:

```@docs
model(gf::FamilyOfG4Fluxes)
matrix_integral(gf::FamilyOfG4Fluxes)
matrix_rational(gf::FamilyOfG4Fluxes)
offset(gf::FamilyOfG4Fluxes)
d3_tadpole_constraint(fgs::FamilyOfG4Fluxes; check::Bool = true)
```

### Properties of a Flux Family

To test whether a family satisfies standard physical consistency conditions, use:

```@docs
is_well_quantized(fgs::FamilyOfG4Fluxes)
passes_transversality_checks(fgs::FamilyOfG4Fluxes)
breaks_non_abelian_gauge_group(fgs::FamilyOfG4Fluxes)
```

### Constructing Flux Instances from a Flux Family

You can generate specific fluxes within a family using:

```@docs
flux_instance(fgs::FamilyOfG4Fluxes, int_combination::ZZMatrix, rat_combination::QQMatrix; check::Bool = true)
random_flux_instance(fgs::FamilyOfG4Fluxes; check::Bool = true)
```

For convenience, a random physically consistent flux can also be generated directly from a model:

```@docs
random_flux(m::AbstractFTheoryModel; not_breaking::Bool = false, check::Bool = true)
```

### Recovering a Flux Family from a Flux Instance

Starting from a single ``G_4``-flux, you can find the full family of fluxes that share its physical properties:

```@docs
g4_flux_family(gf::G4Flux; check::Bool = true)
```

To determine the location of the original flux within that family, retrieve its defining coefficients and offset:

```@docs
integral_coefficients(gf::G4Flux)
rational_coefficients(gf::G4Flux)
offset(gf::G4Flux)
```

## [Advanced Methods](@id advanced_g4_methods)

Let ``X_\Sigma`` be a complete, simplicial toric variety.

According to Theorem 9.3.2 in [Cox, Little, Schenck 2011](@cite CLS11), such varieties satisfy 
``H^{p, q}(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q}) = 0`` whenever ``p \neq q``. This implies that 
``H^{2,2}(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q}) = H^4(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})``.

Theorem 12.4.1 in [Cox, Little, Schenck 2011](@cite CLS11) shows that ``H^4(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})`` is isomorphic to 
``R_\mathbb{Q}(\Sigma)_2``—the degree-2 part of the cohomology ring 
``R_\mathbb{Q}(\Sigma)``. This ring is given by

``R_\mathbb{Q}(\Sigma) = \mathbb{Q}[x_1, ..., x_r] / (I_{SR} + I_{lin})``

where ``r`` is the number of rays in the fan ``\Sigma``, ``I_{SR}`` is the Stanley--Reisner ideal, and ``I_{lin}`` is
the ideal of linear relations.

The following method computes a basis for ``H^{2,2}(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})`` by multiplying pairs of cohomology classes
associated with toric coordinates:

```@docs
basis_of_h22_ambient(m::AbstractFTheoryModel)
```

By default, the method checks if the toric variety is complete and simplicial, but these checks can be skipped by
setting `check=false`.

To identify which pairs of classes were used to compute the basis, use:

```@docs
basis_of_h22_ambient_indices(m::AbstractFTheoryModel)
```

A dictionary mapping any element of ``H^{2,2}(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})`` into this basis is available via:

```@docs
converter_dict_h22_ambient(m::AbstractFTheoryModel)
```

---

Now consider a hypersurface ``\widehat{Y}_4`` inside ``X_\Sigma``. We can compute a subspace of its vertical middle
cohomology:

``\left. H^{2,2}(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q}) \right|_{\widehat{Y}_4} \subseteq H^{2,2}_{\text{vert}}(\widehat{Y}_4, \mathbb{Q})``

To do this, we restrict the ambient basis (from `basis_of_h22_ambient`) to ``\widehat{Y}_4``. Only basic checks are done
to see if elements vanish upon restriction. No advanced vanishing checks or relation checks are executed.

The resulting list of generators is available with:

```@docs
gens_of_h22_hypersurface(m::AbstractFTheoryModel)
```

The corresponding index pairs used for multiplication are available via:

```@docs
gens_of_h22_hypersurface_indices(m::AbstractFTheoryModel)
```

To map classes from ``H^{2,2}(X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})`` into the hypersurface basis, we use the following dictionary:

```@docs
converter_dict_h22_hypersurface(m::AbstractFTheoryModel)
```
