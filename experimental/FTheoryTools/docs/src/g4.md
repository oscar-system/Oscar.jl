## Ambient Space Models for G4-Fluxes

Focus on 4-dimensional F-theory models $m$, such that the resolution $\widehat{Y}_4$
of the defining singular elliptically fibered CY 4-fold $\Y_4 \twoheadrightarrow B_3$
is defined as hypersurface in a complete and simplicial toric variety $X_\Sigma$. In
such a setup, it is convenient to focus on $G_4$-fluxes modelled from the restriction
of elements of $H^{(2,2)}( X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})$ to $\widehat{Y}_4$. This method
identifies a basis of $H^{(2,2)}( X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})$ and filters out elements,
whose restricton to $\widehat{Y}_4$ is obviously trivial.

It is important to elaborate a bit more on the meaning of "obviously". To this end, fix a
basis element of $H^{(2,2)}( X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})$. Let us denote a corresponding algebraic
cycle by $A = \mathbb{V}(x_i, x_j) \subset X_\Sigma$, where $x_i$, $x_j$ are suitable
homogeneous coordinates. Furthermore, let $\widehat{Y}_4 = \mathbb{V}( p ) \subset X_\Sigma$.
Then of course, we can look at the set-theoretic intersection $\mathbb{V}( p, x_i, x_j)$.
Provided that $p(x_i = 0, x_j = 0)$ is a non-zero constant, this set-theoretic intersection
is trivial. This is exactly the check conducted by the method `ambient_space_models_of_g4_fluxes`
below. However, for reasons of simplicity, this approach is avoid a number of sutleties.

Namely, we really have to work out the intersection in the Chow ring, that is we should consider
the rational equivalence class of the algebraic cycle $A$ and intersect this class with the
rational equivalence class of the algebraic cycle $\mathbb{V}( p )$. In particular, for
"unlucky" choices of $i, j$, the algebraic cycles $\mathbb{V}( p )$ and $\mathbb{V}(x_i, x_j)$
may not intersect transversely. This is for instance the case if $i = j$. Such phenomena are
addressed in theory by "moving the algebraic cycles into general position", but in practice this
somewhat tricky. Instances include the following:
1. $i = j$: Then apparently, a self-intersection of $\mathbb{V}(x_i)$ is involved.
2. $p(x_i, x_j) \equiv 0$: This is unexpected for dimensional reasons, and indicates a
non-transverse intersection.

In both instances, one makes use of the linear relations of $X_\Sigma$ to replace the cycle 
 $\mathbb{V}(x_i)$ (and/or $\mathbb{V}(x_j)$) with a rational combination of algebraic cycles
$R = \sum_{k = 1}^{N}{c_k \cdot A_k}$, such that $R$ is rationally equivalent to $\mathbb{V}(x_i)$.
From experience, it is then rather common that $R$ and $\mathbb{V}(x_i)$ intersect transversely.
And if not, then modify the non-transverse intersections by using the linear relations again to
replace an involved algebraic cycle.

Among the $G_4$-flux candidates, the physics is interested in the well-quantized fluxes. That is,
those cohomology classes which integrate to an integer against any other 2-cycle in the elliptic
4-fold $\widehat{Y}_4$. Even in theory, this is a hard task. In practice, one therefore focuses
on consistency checks. In the case at hand, we can integrate any ambient space $G_4$-flux candidate
against a pair of (algebraic cycles associated to) toric divisors. If for any two toric divisors,
the result is an integer, then this $G_4$-flux candidate passes a rather non-trivial and necessary
test. The following method identifies all $G_4$-flux ambient space candidates which pass this test.
Please note that this method may take a long time to execute for involved geometries $\widehat{Y}_4$.

Similarly, we have a method for all vertical and well-quantized ambient space $G_4$-flux candidates:
