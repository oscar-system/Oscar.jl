# G4-Fluxes

$G_4$-fluxes are at the heart of F-theory model building.


## Constructors

We currently support the following constructor:
```@docs
g4_flux(model::AbstractFTheoryModel, class::CohomologyClass)
```
In addition to this generic constructor, we also support the following special constructor.
```@docs
qsm_flux(qsm_model::AbstractFTheoryModel)
```



## Attributes

We currently support the following attributes:
```@docs
model(gf::G4Flux)
cohomology_class(gf::G4Flux)
d3_tadpole_constraint(gf::G4Flux; check::Bool = true)
g4_flux_family(gf::G4Flux; check::Bool = true)
```
Note that such a family of $G_4$-fluxes expresses its elements
as linear combinations of the basis elements. Crucially, some
of the coefficients must only be integers, whilst the remaining
coefficients can be any rational number. With the following
methods one can extract those coefficients for a given $G_4$-flux.
```@docs
integral_coefficients(gf::G4Flux)
rational_coefficients(gf::G4Flux)
```


## Methods

You can create instances of families of G4-fluxes, i.e. a flux that
is contained in said family. For this, we support the following:
```@docs
flux_instance(fgs::FamilyOfG4Fluxes, int_combination::ZZMatrix, rat_combination::QQMatrix; check::Bool = true)
random_flux_instance(fgs::FamilyOfG4Fluxes; check::Bool = true)
```
For convenience, we also support the following method to create a
random $G_4$-flux with prescribed properties on a given F-theory model:
```@docs
random_flux(m::AbstractFTheoryModel; not_breaking::Bool = false, check::Bool = true)
```

## Properties

We currently support the following properties:
```@docs
is_well_quantized(gf::G4Flux)
passes_tadpole_cancellation_check(gf::G4Flux)
passes_transversality_checks(gf::G4Flux)
breaks_non_abelian_gauge_group(gf::G4Flux)
```


## Ambient Space Models for G4-Fluxes

Focus on 4-dimensional F-theory models $m$, such that the resolution $\widehat{Y}_4$
of the defining singular elliptically fibered CY 4-fold $\Y_4 \twoheadrightarrow B_3$
is defined as hypersurface in a complete and simplicial toric variety $X_\Sigma$. In
such a setup, it is convenient to focus on $G_4$-fluxes modelled from the restriction
of elements of $H^{(2,2)}( X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})$ to $\widehat{Y}_4$. This method
identifies a basis of $H^{(2,2)}( X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})$ and filters out elements,
whose restricton to $\widehat{Y}_4$ is obviously trivial.

It is important to elaborate a bit more on the meaning of "obviously". To this end, fix a
basis element of $H^{(2,2)}( X_\Sigma, \mathbb{Q})$. Let us denote a corresponding algebraic
cycle by $A = \mathbb{V}(x_i, x_j) \subset X_\Sigma$, where $x_i$, $x_j$ are suitable
homogeneous coordinates. Furthermore, let $\widehat{Y}_4 = \mathbb{V}( p ) \subset X_\Sigma$.
Then of course, we can look at the set-theoretic intersection $\mathbb{V}( p, x_i, x_j)$.
Provided that $p(x_i = 0, x_j = 0)$ is a non-zero constant, this set-theoretic intersection
is trivial. This is exactly the check conducted by the method `chosen_g4_flux_basis`
below. However, for reasons of simplicity, this approach is avoid a number of sutleties.

Namely, we really have to work out the intersection in the Chow ring, that is we should consider
the rational equivalence class of the algebraic cycle $A$ and intersect this class with the
rational equivalence class of the algebraic cycle $\mathbb{V}( p )$. In particular, for
"unlucky" choices of $i, j$, the algebraic cycles $\mathbb{V}( p )$ and $\mathbb{V}(x_i, x_j)$
may not intersect transversely. This is for instance the case if $i = j$. Such phenomena are
addressed in theory by "moving the algebraic cycles into general position", but in practice this
somewhat tricky. Instances include the following:
1. $i = j$: Then apparently, a self-intersection of $\mathbb{V}(x_i)$ is involved.
2. $p(x_i, x_j) \equiv 0$: This is unexpected for dimensional reasons, and indicates a
non-transverse intersection.

In both instances, one makes use of the linear relations of $X_\Sigma$ to replace the cycle 
 $\mathbb{V}(x_i)$ (and/or $\mathbb{V}(x_j)$) with a rational combination of algebraic cycles
$R = \sum_{k = 1}^{N}{c_k \cdot A_k}$, such that $R$ is rationally equivalent to $\mathbb{V}(x_i)$.
From experience, it is then rather common that $R$ and $\mathbb{V}(x_i)$ intersect transversely.
And if not, then modify the non-transverse intersections by using the linear relations again to
replace an involved algebraic cycle.

### Constructor

Physics often is interested in families of G4-fluxes, that are expressed in terms of
integral or rational combinations of the ambient space models of G4-fluxes, that we

```

### Attributes

```


## Special Families of G4-Fluxes

Among the $G_4$-flux candidates, the physics is interested in the well-quantized fluxes that pass
the transversality conditions. Regarding the quantization condition, this means that we seek
those cohomology classes which integrate to an integer against any other 2-cycle in the elliptic
4-fold $\widehat{Y}_4$. Even in theory, this is a hard task. In practice, one therefore focuses
on consistency checks. In the case at hand, we can integrate any ambient space $G_4$-flux candidate
against a pair of (algebraic cycles associated to) toric divisors. If for any two toric divisors,
the result is an integer, then this $G_4$-flux candidate passes a rather non-trivial and necessary
test. 

Similarly, we have a method that identifies all fluxes which are well-quantized, pass the
transversality conditions and in addition to this do not break the non-abelian gauge group.
For these families, we support the following constructor. Please note that this method may take a long
time to execute for involved geometries $\widehat{Y}_4$.
