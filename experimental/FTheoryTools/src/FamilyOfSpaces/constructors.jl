    family_of_spaces(coordinate_ring::MPolyRing, grading::Matrix{Int64}, dim::Int)

Return a family of spaces that is (currently) used to build
families of F-theory models, defined by using a family of
base spaces for an elliptic fibration. It is specified by
the following data:
* A polynomial ring. This may be thought of as the coordinate
ring of the generic member in this family of spaces.
* A grading for this polynomial ring. This may be thought of as
specifying certain line bundles on the generic member in this
family of spaces. Of particular interest for F-theory is always
the canonical bundle. For this reason, the first row is always
thought of as grading the coordinate ring with regard to the
canonical bundle. Or put differently, if a variable shares the
weight 1 in the first row, then this means that we should think
of this coordinate as a section of 1 times the canonical bundle.
* An integer, which specifies the dimension of the generic member
within this family of spaces.

Note that the coordinate ring can have strictly more variables than
the dimension. This is a desired feature for most, if not all,
F-theory literature constructions.
