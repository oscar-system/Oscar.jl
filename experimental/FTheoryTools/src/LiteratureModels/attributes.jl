    weighted_resolution_zero_sections(m::AbstractFTheoryModel)

Return a list of known Mordellâ€“Weil zero sections for the
given model after each known weighted resolution. Each element of the
list corresponds to a known weighted resolution (in the same order).
If no weighted resolution zero sections are known, an error is raised.
