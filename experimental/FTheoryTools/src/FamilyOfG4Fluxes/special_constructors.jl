    special_flux_family(m::AbstractFTheoryModel; vert::Bool = false, not_breaking::Bool = false, check::Bool = true)

Computes a family of G4-fluxes with specified properties for a given F-theory model `m`,
defined as a hypersurface in a simplicial and complete toric ambient space.

### Description
This method models the G4-flux family using the restriction of cohomology classes on the
toric ambient space to the hypersurface. In the toric ambient space, these classes are vertical,
meaning they are of the form $a \wedge b$, where $a, b \in H^(1,1)(X_\Sigma)$, with $X_\Sigma$
denoting the toric ambient space. However, this does not imply that the classes remain vertical
on the hypersurface, which defines the actual F-theory geometry.

The resulting family is subjected to consistency conditions to ensure it satisfies elementary
quantization requirements. By default, the method returns ambient space G4-flux candidates that
meet these conditions, unless explicitly specified otherwise.

### Optional Arguments
- `vert = true`: Refines the family to include only fluxes that are vertical on the hypersurface.
- `not_breaking = true`: Ensures the flux family preserves the non-abelian gauge group.
- `check = false`: Skips computational checks for whether the toric ambient space $X_\Sigma$ is complete and simplicial, which can be resource-intensive.

### Notes
!!! warning
    This method assumes that $c_2( \widehat{Y}_4)$ is even. No checks or errors are implemented for this condition, so use cautiously.

This assumption relates to the quantization condition, which requires verifying if the twist of a
given $G_4$-flux by $1/2 \cdot c_2( \widehat{Y}_4)$ is even. For many F-theory models, such as
compactifications on smooth Calabi-Yau 4-folds with globally defined Weierstrass models ([CS12](@cite)),
$c_2( \widehat{Y}_4)$ is known to be even. This also applies to all F-theory QSMs ([CHLLT19](@cite)).

### Computational Details
The method internally identifies two matrices related to the family of fluxes:
1. `matrix_integral`: Specifies rational combinations of ambient space G4-flux candidates that can only form $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combinations without violating elementary flux quantization conditions.
2. `matrix_rational`: Specifies rational combinations of flux candidates for which any rational linear combination satisfies the elementary flux quantization conditions.

These matrices are accessible for further analysis.

Next, let us focus on vertical and well-quantized fluxes.

Finally, we demonstrate the computation of the well-quantized, vertical $G_4$-fluxes,
which do not break the non-abelian gauge group.

  # (7) In other words, we have S * (U^(-1) * q) = d * (T*n).
  # (7) Note that T*n are just other integers, which we may use to parametrize the space of solutions. Let us thus write:
