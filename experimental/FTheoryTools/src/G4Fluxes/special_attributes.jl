    basis_of_h22(v::NormalToricVariety; check::Bool = true)::Vector{CohomologyClass}

By virtue of Theorem 12.4.1 in [CLS11](@cite), one can compute a monomial
basis of $H^4(X, \mathbb{Q})$ for a simplicial, complete toric variety $X$
by truncating its cohomology ring to degree $2$. Inspired by this, this
method identifies a basis of $H^{(2,2)}(X, \mathbb{Q})$ by multiplying
pairs of cohomology classes associated with toric coordinates.

By definition, $H^{(2,2)}(X, \mathbb{Q})$ is a subset of $H^{4}(X, \mathbb{Q})$.
However, by Theorem 9.3.2 in [CLS11](@cite), for complete and simplicial
toric varieties and $p \neq q$ it holds $H^{(p,q)}(X, \mathbb{Q}) = 0$. It follows
that for such varieties $H^{(2,2)}(X, \mathbb{Q}) = H^4(X, \mathbb{Q})$ and the
vector space dimension of those spaces agrees with the Betti number $b_4(X)$.

Note that it can be computationally very demanding to check if a toric variety
$X$ is complete (and simplicial). The optional argument `check` can be set
to `false` to skip these tests.

Given an F-theory model $m$ defined as hypersurface in a simplicial and
complete toric base, we this method first computes a basis of
$H^(2,2)(X, \mathbb{Q})$ (by use of the method `basis_of_h22` below) and then filters
out "some" basis elements whose restriction to the hypersurface in question
is trivial. The exact meaning of "some" is explained above this method.

Note that it can be computationally very demanding to check if a toric variety
$X$ is complete (and simplicial). The optional argument `check` can be set
to `false` to skip these tests.
