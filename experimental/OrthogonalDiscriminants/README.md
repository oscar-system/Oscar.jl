# OrthogonalDiscriminants
  
A current project of [Gabriele Nebe](https://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Gabriele.Nebe) and Richard Parker is the computation of orthogonal discriminants of irreducible orthogonal representations of many simple groups whose character tables are shown in the [Atlas of Finite Groups](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/atlas-of-finite-groups-9780198531999).
