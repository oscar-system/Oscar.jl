# Quadratic forms and isometries

This project is a complement to the code about *hermitian lattices* available
in Hecke. We aim here to connect Hecke and GAP to handle some algorithmic
methods regarding quadratic forms with their isometries. In particular,
the integration of this code within Oscar is necessary to benefit from all the
performance of GAP with respect to computations with groups and automorphisms in
general.

For now, the project covers methods regarding rational and integral quadratic
forms.

## Content

We introduce two new structures
* [`QuadSpaceWithIsom`](@ref)
* [`ZZLatWithIsom`](@ref)
The former parametrizes pairs $(V, f)$ where $V$ is a rational quadratic form
and $f$ is an isometry of $V$. The latter parametrizes pairs $(L, f)$ where
$L$ is an integral quadratic form, also known as $\mathbb Z$-lattice and $f$
is an isometry of $L$. One of the main features of this project is the
enumeration of isomorphism classes of pairs $(L, f)$, where $f$ is an isometry
of finite order with at most two prime divisors. The methods we resort to
for this purpose are developed in the paper [BH23].

We also provide some algorithms computing isomorphism classes of primitive
embeddings of even lattices following Nikulin's theory. More precisely, the two
functions `primitive_embeddings_in_primary_lattice` and
`primitive_embeddings_of_primary_lattice` offer, under certain conditions,
the possibility to compute representatives of primitive embeddings and classify
them in different ways. Note nonetheless that these functions are not efficient
in the case were the discriminant groups have a large number of subgroups.

## Status

This project has been slightly tested on simple and known examples. It is
currently being tested on a larger scale to test its reliability. Moreover,
there are still computational bottlenecks due to non-optimized algorithms.

Among the possible improvements and extensions:
* Implement extra methods for lattices with isometries of infinite order;
* Extend the methods for classification of primitive embeddings to the more
  general case (knowing that we lose efficiency for large discriminant groups);
* Extend existing methods for equivariant primitive embeddings/extensions.

## Currently application of this project

The project was initiated by S. Brandhorst and T. Hofmann for classifying
finite subgroups of automorphisms of K3 surfaces. Our current goal is to use
this code, and further extensions of it, to classify finite subgroups of
bimeromorphic self-maps of *hyperkaehler manifolds*, which are a higher
dimensional analogues of K3 surface.

## Notice to the user

### Disclaimer

Since this project is still under development, feel free to try any feature and
report all the bugs you may have found. Any suggestions for improvements or
extensions are more than welcome. Refer to the next section to know who you
should contact and how. Do not hesitate either to ask for new features - we
will be glad to add anything you may need for your research.

One may expect many things to vary within the next months: name of the
functions, available features, performance. This is due to the fact that the
current version of the code is still at an experimental stage.

### Report an issue

If you are working with some objects of type `QuadSpaceWithIsom` or `ZZLatWithIsom`
and you need to report an issue, you can produce directly some lines of codes
helping to reconstruct your example. This can help the reviewers to understand
your issue and assist you. We have implemented a method `to_oscar` which
prints few lines of codes for reconstructing your example.

```@repl 2
using Oscar # hide
V = quadratic_space(QQ, 2);
Vf = quadratic_space_with_isometry(V, neg = true)
Oscar.to_oscar(Vf)

Lf = lattice(Vf)
Oscar.to_oscar(Lf)
```

## Make the code more talkative

Within the code, there are more hidden messages and testing which are disabled
by default. If you plan to experiment with the codes with your favourite
examples, you may want to be able to detect some issues to be reported, as well
as knowing what the code is doing. Indeed, some functions might take time in
term of compilation but also computations. For this, you can enable these extra
tests and printings by setting:
                                                                                                     
```julia
Oscar.set_lwi_level(2)
```
