# OscarDB

This module provides a general database framework which, conceptually, works for all OSCAR types.

There are two main ingredients:
- the database backend is [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com);
- communication with the database relies on OSCAR's serialization, via the mrdi file format [D-VJL24*1](@cite).

The overall design is inspired by polymake's [PolyDB](https://polydb.org/).

## Collections

The database is organized into collections.
Within each collection the datasets are uniform.

### Vertex-transitive combinatorial manifolds [TransitiveSimplicialComplexes]
The OSCAR DB provides access to [Frank Lutz' collection of vertex transitive triangulations](https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/IfM/Nachrufe/Frank_Lutz/stellar/vertex-transitive-triangulations.html).
It comprises all vertex-transitive combinatorial manifolds with up to 15 vertices in dimensions $d=2,3,9,10,11,12$.
In the remaining dimensions below 12, the enumeration is complete up to 13 vertices.

See also [Lut08](@cite).

### Leech pairs [LeechPairs]
The OSCAR DB provides access to the [fixed-point sublattices of the Leech lattice](http://monstrous-moonshine.de/~gerald/),
computed by Gerald HÃ¶hn and Geoffrey Mason.
Each entry of the collection is a pair consisting of a copy of the Leech lattice
and of the largest subgroup of the Conway group fixing pointwise the associated
fixed-point sublattice.

See also [HM16](@cite), Table 1, and [the supplementary non-published tables](https://arxiv.org/src/1505.06420v3/anc).

### Small trees database [SmallTreeModels]

The OSCAR DB provides access to [Algebraic Phylogenetics](algebraicphylogenetics.org), 
see also [Small Phylogenetic Trees](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/aapps/ldg/small-trees/small-trees_0.html) for the list of contributors.
Which comprises of phylogenetic models on trees with up to 5 leaves.
