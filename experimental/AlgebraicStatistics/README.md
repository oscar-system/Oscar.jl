# AlgebraicStatistics

## Aims

This experimental package provides tools for *algebraic statistics*,
facilitating the use of commutative algebra to solve problems in
statistics.

The interface is loosely modeled after the [`GraphicalModels`](https://macaulay2.com/doc/Macaulay2/share/doc/Macaulay2/GraphicalModels/html/index.html)
package of [`Macaulay2`](https://macaulay2.com) but it fully embraces
features of Julia's type system. We intend to first get the functionality
of this package on par with its `Macaulay2` predecessor before adding
new functionality.
