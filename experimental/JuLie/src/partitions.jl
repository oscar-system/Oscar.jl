    Partition{T<:IntegerUnion} <: AbstractVector{T}

A **partition** of a non-negative integer ``n`` is a decreasing sequence ``λ₁ ≥ λ₂ ≥ … ≥
λᵣ`` of positive integers ``λᵢ`` such that ``n = λ₁ + … + λᵣ``. The ``λᵢ`` are called the
**parts** of the partition and ``r`` is called the **length**. 

A partition can be encoded as an array with elements ``λᵢ``. We provide the parametric type
`Partition{T}` which is a subtype of `AbstractVector{T}` where `T` can be any subtype of
`IntegerUnion`. All functions that can be used for vectors (1-dimensional arrays) can thus
be used for partitions as well. There is no performance impact by using an own type for
partitions rather than simply using arrays. The parametric type allows to increase
performance by using smaller integer types. For efficiency, the `Partition` constructor does
not check whether the given array is indeed a decreasing sequence.

A partition can be created by either calling `partition` on an array of integers or by
calling `partition` with arguments being the sequence of parts, with the possibility
to provide the element type as the first argument.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> P = partition([6,4,4,2]) #The partition 6+4+4+2 of 16.
[6, 4, 4, 2]

julia> P = partition(6,4,4,2) #Same as above but less to type
[6, 4, 4, 2]

julia> length(P)
4

julia> P[1]
6
```
Usually, ``|λ| ≔ n`` is called the **size** of ``λ``. In Julia, the function `size` for
arrays already exists and returns the *dimension* of an array. Instead, you can use the
Julia function `sum` to get the sum of the parts.
```jldoctest
julia> P = partition(6,4,4,2)
[6, 4, 4, 2]

julia> sum(P) 
16
```
You can create partitions with smaller integer types as follows.
```jldoctest
julia> P = partition(Int8,6,4,4,2) #Or partition(Int8[6,4,4,2])
Int8[6, 4, 4, 2]
```
There is a unique partition of 0, namely the **empty partition** (of length 0). It can be
created as follows.
```jldoctest
julia> P = partition() #Or partition([])
Int64[]
julia> sum(P)
0
julia> length(P)
0
julia> P = partition(Int8) #Or partition(Int8[])
Int8[]
```

    getindex_safe(P::Partition, i::IntegerUnion)

In algorithms involving partitions it is sometimes convenient to be able to access parts
beyond the length of the partition and then one wants to get the value zero instead of an
error. This function is a shortcut for
```
return (i>length(P.p) ? 0 : getindex(P.p,i))
```
If you are sure that `P[i]` exists, use `getindex` because this will be faster.

# Examples
```jldoctest

smaller integer types.

    ascending_partitions(n::IntegerUnion; algorithm::Symbol=:ks)

Instead of encoding a partition of an integer ``n ≥ 0`` as a *descending*
sequence (which is our convention), one can also encode it as an *ascending*
sequence. In the papers Kelleher & O'Sullivan (2014) and Merca (2012) it is
said that generating the list of all ascending partitions is more efficient
than generating descending ones. To test this, we have implemented the
algorithms given in the papers:
1. `:ks` (*default*) is the algorithm "AccelAsc" (Algorithm 4.1) in [KO14](@cite).
2. `:m` is Algorithm 6 in [Mer12](@cite). This is actually similar to `:ks`.

The ascending partitions are stored here as arrays and are not of type
`Partition` since the latter are descending by our convention. We are using `:ks`
as default since it looks slicker.

# Comparison

We don't see a significant speed difference to the descending encoding:

A list of all partitions of a non-negative integer `m` into `n >= 0` parts with lower bound
`l1 >= 0` and upper bound `l2` for the parts. There are two choices for the parameter
`only_distinct_parts`:
* `false`: no further restriction (*default*);

    partitions(m::T, v::Vector{T}, mu::Vector{S}) where {T<:IntegerUnion,S<:IntegerUnion}
  
All partitions of a non-negative integer `m` where each part is an element in the vector `v`
of positive integers and each `v[i]` occurs a maximum of `mu[i] > 0` times. We assume
(without loss of generality) that the entries in `v` are strictly increasing.

# Example
We compute all partitions of 100 where the parts are from {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50} and each
part is allowed to occur at most twice:

    dominates(lambda::Partition, mu::Partition)

The **dominance order** on partitions is the partial order ``⊵`` defined by ``λ ⊵ μ`` if and
only if ``λ₁ + … + λᵢ ≥ μ₁ + … + μᵢ`` for all i. If ``λ ⊵ μ`` one says that ``λ``
**dominates** ``μ``. This function returns true if and only if `lambda` dominates `mu`.

Note that whereas the lexicographic ordering is a total ordering, the dominance ordering is
not.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> dominates( partition(3,1), partition(2,2) )
true

julia> dominates( partition(4,1), partition(3,3) )
false
```

# Remarks
[Knu11](@cite) says **majorizes** instead of **dominates** and uses the symbol ``⪰`` instead
of ``⊵``.
