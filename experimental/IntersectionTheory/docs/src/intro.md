# Introduction

A variety in this chapter is a smooth irreducible projective algebraic set over the complex numbers. A subvariety
of a variety $X$ is an irreducible algebraic subset of $X$. We will
- present OSCAR tools which support computations in the intersection theory of varieties, and
- give examples which illustrate how intersection theory is used to solve problems from enumerative geometry.

!!! note
    A first version of what we present here was written by Jeiao Song as a separate `julia` package based on OSCAR.
    This package was "heavily inspired by the Macaulay2 package `Schubert2` and the `sage` library `Chow`.
    Some functionalities from [the `sage` library] `Schubert3` are also implemented."
    The authors of `Schubert2` are Daniel R. Grayson, Michael E. Stillman, Stein A. Strømme, David Eisenbud, and Charley Crissman,
    while `Chow` is due to Manfred Lehn and Christoph Sorger. `Schubert3` as well as the `Singular` library `schubert.lib` is due
    to Dang Tuan Hiep. All this work, including ours, is inspired by the `Maple` package `Schubert` written
    by Sheldon Katz and Stein A. Strømme.

The starting point for developing the `Schubert` package was the problem of enumerating twisted cubic curves
on a general quintic hypersurface in $\mathbb P^4$, see [ES02](@cite). We quote from that paper:

> One way to approach enumerative problems is to find a suitable complete parameter space for the objects that one wants to count, and express the locus of objects satisfying given conditions as a certain zero-cycle on the parameter space. For this method to yield an explicit numerical answer, one needs in particular to be able to evaluate the degree of a given zerodimensional cycle class. This is possible in principle whenever the numerical intersection ring (cycles modulo numerical equivalence) of the parameter space is known, say in terms of generators and relations.

A cycle on a variety $X$ is a finite formal sum of subvarieties of $X$, with integer coefficients.
There are several adequate equivalence relations on cycles leading to useful cycle theories. The most common relation to
work with is rational equivalence which yields intersection rings called Chow rings. In contrast to this usual practice, following
the authors of `Schubert`, we consider numerical equivalence, allowing rational coefficients when forming cycles. That is, if
$N^\ast(X)$ is the numerical intersection ring of a variety $X$, we consider the ring

$N^\ast(X)_{\mathbb Q} = N^\ast(X) \otimes_{\mathbb Z} {\mathbb Q}.$

We grade this ring by the codimension of cycle classes. In particular, as $\mathbb Q$-vector spaces, $N^{0}(X)_{\mathbb Q}\cong\mathbb Q$
is generated by the fundamental class $\left[X\right]$ of $X$, and $N^{\dim(X)}(X)_{\mathbb Q}$ is formed by the 0-dimensional cycle classes.
Note that we have a well-defined *degree homomorphism* , or *integral*,

$\deg =\int_X : N^{\dim(X)}(X)_{\mathbb Q}  \rightarrow \mathbb Q$

which sends the class of each point of $X$ to 1, and which extends to a homomorphism on all of $N^\ast(X)_{\mathbb Q}$:

$\int_X : N^\ast(X)_{\mathbb Q} \rightarrow \mathbb Q,  \quad c = \sum _{i = 0}^{\dim(X)} c_i\mapsto \int c_{\dim(X)}.$

!!! note
    In this chapter, the name *Chow ring* always refers to a ring of type $N^\ast(X)_{\mathbb Q}$.

    TODO: Why numerical intersection rings?

With respect to computations, again following `Schubert`, our approach is abstract in the
sense that we do not work with explicit varieties given by equations. Instead, we specify the
dimension of the variety together with its Chow ring and, possibly, further data. We refer to such
a collection of data as an *abstract variety*, and to results obtained from manipulating
the data as results which apply to all (smooth projective complex) varieties sharing the data. 

Of particular interest is the tangent bundle of a variety (the Todd class of the
tangent bundle enters the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula). As with any other vector bundle,
the tangent bundle is represented as a collection of data referred to as an *abstract vector bundle*.
The main data here is the Chern character of the vector bundle.

In the same spirit, we introduce  *abstract variety maps*. Their key data is the pullback 
morphism between the respective Chow rings.

Some comments on this set-up are in order:

Let $X$ be a variety. Write $K^{\circ}(X)$  for the *Grothendieck group of vector bundles on $X$*. That is,
$K^{\circ} (X)$ is the free abelian group generated by the isomorphy classes of vector bundles on $X$,
modulo the relations of type $[E]=[E^{\prime}]-[E^{\prime \prime}]$, where $E$, $E^\prime$, and
$ E^{\prime \prime}$ fit into an exact sequence
$0\rightarrow E^\prime \rightarrow E \rightarrow E^{\prime \prime} \rightarrow 0$.
The tensor product turns $K^{\circ}(X)$ into a ring,  the *Grothendieck ring of vector bundles on $X$*.
By Riemann-Roch, the Chern character defines a ring isomorphism $\text{ch}: K^{\circ}(X)_{\mathbb Q}
\overset{\simeq}\longrightarrow A^*(X) _{\mathbb Q}$, where $A^*(X)$ is obtained by considering cycles
modulo rational equivalence. Since rational equivalence is (much) finer than
numerical equivalence, we obtain a ring epimorphism

$\text{ch}: K^{\circ}(X)_{\mathbb Q}
\overset{\simeq}\longrightarrow A^*(X) _{\mathbb Q}\twoheadrightarrow N^*(X)_{\mathbb Q}.$

!!! note
    Write $K_{\circ} (X)$  for the *Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves on $X$*.
    Then, since $X$ is supposed to be smooth, the natural map $K^{\circ} (X)\rightarrow K_{\circ} (X)$ is an isomorphism
    (every coherent sheaf on $X$ has a finite resolution by locally free sheaves). We may, thus, speak of coherent sheaves
    given by *virtual vector bundles*, that is, by elements of $K^{\circ} (X)$. Hence,  we can use the concept of abstract
    vector bundles also to infer information on coherent sheaves, with algebraic operations such as `-` or `*` (tensor product)
    being virtual.

In many cases, we won't be able to compute the entire Chow ring: We will only be able to obtain information on a certain
subring generated by some tautological classes. Therefore, we are then actually working with the class of all varieties
sharing the same piece of tautological ring (and, possibly, further data). We illustrate this by an example:

```jldoctest
julia> P3 = abstract_projective_space(3)
AbstractVariety of dim 3

julia> S1 = zero_locus_section(OO(P3, 3)) # cubic hypersurface in P3
AbstractVariety of dim 2

julia> basis(S1)  # only class in codimension 1 is hyperplane class
3-element Vector{Vector{MPolyQuoRingElem}}:
 [1]
 [h]
 [h^2]

julia> P2 = abstract_projective_space(2);

julia> S2 = blow_up_points(P2, 6) # construct surface S2 by blowing up P2 in 6 points
AbstractVariety of dim 2

julia> basis(S2) # more classes in codimension 1 here
3-element Vector{Vector{MPolyQuoRingElem}}:
 [1]
 [h, e[1], e[2], e[3], e[4], e[5], e[6]]
 [h^2]

julia> e, h = gens(S2)[1:6], gens(S2)[end];

julia> H = 3h - sum(e); # embeds S2 as cubic hypersurface into P3:

julia> integral(H^2)
3

julia> euler_characteristic(OO(S2, H))
4

julia> f = map(S2, S1, [H]) # is isomorphism:
AbstractVarietyMap from AbstractVariety of dim 2 to AbstractVariety of dim 2

julia> dim(f)
0

julia> chern_character(tangent_bundle(f))
0

```

Although `f` is an isomorphism, applying the constructed pushforward map to the classes `e[i]` will
yield a warning and not give a correct answer.

!!! note
    TODO: Improve the following. 
    For a number of varieties which are of interest to us here, numerical equivalence coincides with rational equivalence.
    In this case, the Chow ring coincides with the rational cohomology ring and can be completely computed, so problems
    as above disappear. A nice consequence is that the Betti numbers of the Chow ring are exactly the (even) Betti numbers
    of the variety itself, so we have an equality `sum(betti_numbers(X)) == euler_number(X)`.
    The class of these varieties includes projective spaces, Grassmannians, homogeneous spaces for affine algebraic
    groups (for example, flag varieties), and in general any variety with an affine stratification. Moreover, products,
    projective bundles, and blowups with center in this class will remain in this class. Internally, we use
    `set_attribute(X, :alg => true)` to declare that X satisfies this property. Accordingly, entering `get_attribute(X, :alg)`
	reveals whether `:alg` has been set to true or not.
