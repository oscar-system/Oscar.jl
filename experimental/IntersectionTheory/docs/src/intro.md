# Introduction

A *variety* in this chapter is a smooth irreducible projective algebraic set over the complex numbers. A *subvariety*
of a variety $X$ is an irreducible algebraic subset of $X$. We will
- present OSCAR tools which support computations in the intersection theory of varieties, and
- give examples which illustrate how intersection theory is used to solve problems from enumerative geometry.

!!! note
    A first version of what we present here was written by Jeiao Song as a separate `julia` package based on OSCAR.
    This package was "heavily inspired by the Macaulay2 package `Schubert2` and the `sage` library `Chow`.
    Some functionalities from [the `sage` library] `Schubert3` are also implemented."
    The authors of `Schubert2` are Daniel R. Grayson, Michael E. Stillman, Stein A. Strømme, David Eisenbud, and Charley Crissman,
    while `Chow` is due to Manfred Lehn and Christoph Sorger. `Schubert3` as well as the `Singular` library `schubert.lib` is due
    to Dang Tuan Hiep. All this work, including ours, is inspired by the `Maple` package `Schubert` written
    by Sheldon Katz and Stein A. Strømme.

The starting point for developing the `Schubert` package was the problem of enumerating twisted cubic curves
on a general quintic hypersurface in $\mathbb P^4$, see [ES02](@cite). We quote from that paper:

> One way to approach enumerative problems is to find a suitable complete parameter space for the objects that one wants to count, and express the locus of objects satisfying given conditions as a certain zero-cycle on the parameter space. For this method to yield an explicit numerical answer, one needs in particular to be able to evaluate the degree of a given zerodimensional cycle class. This is possible in principle whenever the numerical intersection ring (cycles modulo numerical equivalence) of the parameter space is known, say in terms of generators and relations.

A cycle on a variety $X$ is a finite formal sum of subvarieties of $X$, with integer coefficients. That is, a *cycle* on $X$
is an element of the free abelian group $Z(X)$ generated by the subvarieties of $X$. This group is graded by dimension:
$Z_\ast(X) = \bigoplus^{\dim(X)}_{k=0} Z_k(X)$, where $Z_k(X)$ is generated by the cycles of dimension $k$ (called the
*$k$-cycles* on $X$). Useful cycle theories are obtained by choosing an *adequate equivalence relation* on cycles
which gives rise to a suitable concept of *moving cycles* and, thus, to a well-defined intersection product on cycle classes
(see [Sam60](@cite) and the textbooks listed below). As a result, for each such relation $\sim$, the  group $Z_\ast(X)/\sim$
formed by the cycle classes is turned into a ring (*intersection ring*). In what follows, we grade such a ring by the
codimension of cycles (to indicate this, with respect to notation, we use an upper $*$ rather than the lower $*$
used in $Z_\ast(X)$ above). Note that the degree-0  part of such a graded ring (cycle classes of dimension $\dim(X)$), is
isomorphic to $\mathbb Z$, generated by the class $[X]$of $X$, the *fundamental class* of $X$ (recall that we assume
that $X$ is irreducible).

The finest adequate equivalence relation is *rational equivalence* which is the  most common relation to work with
(see the textbooks listed below). The resulting intersection ring of $X$, denoted here by $A^\ast(X)$,  is usually called
the *Chow ring* of $X$. Note that some of the graded parts of such a  ring may be huge and difficult to handle. For
example, while $A^0(X)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z$ as pointed out above, it may happen that the group $A^{\dim(X)}$
is not even finitely generated. For the applications to enumerative geometry
considered here, it is more convenient to follow the authors of `Schubert` and work with numerical equivalence,
the coarsest adequate equivalence relation. This means that we only care about the intersection numbers with respect
to classes in complementary codimension. In many cases of interest in enumerative geometry, this has the additional
benefit that we can deduce pushforwards related to a morphisms of varieties when only the corresponding pullback
homomorphism is known (see the section on [Abstract Variety Maps](@ref)).

For our purposes,  it is also convenient to allow rational coefficients when forming cycles.
That is, if $N^\ast(X)$ is the numerical intersection ring of $X$, we consider the ring

$N^\ast(X)_{\mathbb Q} = N^\ast(X) \otimes_{\mathbb Z} {\mathbb Q} = \bigoplus^{\dim(X)}_{k=0} N^k(X)_{\mathbb Q}.$

The graded pieces $N^k(X)_{\mathbb Q}$ are finite-dimensional $\mathbb Q$-vector spaces. In particular, as
$\mathbb Q$-vector spaces, both $N^{0}(X)_{\mathbb Q}$ and $N^{\dim(X)}(X)_{\mathbb Q}$ are isomorphic to
$\mathbb Q$. In fact, we have a well-defined *degree homomorphism* , or *integral*,

$\deg =\int_X : N^{\dim(X)}(X)_{\mathbb Q}  \overset{\cong}\longrightarrow \mathbb Q$

which sends the class of each point of $X$ to 1, and which extends to a homomorphism on all of $N^\ast(X)_{\mathbb Q}$:

$\int_X : N^\ast(X)_{\mathbb Q} \rightarrow \mathbb Q,  \quad c = \sum _{k = 0}^{\dim(X)} c_k\mapsto \int c_{\dim(X)}.$

The dimensions $\beta_k = \dim N^c(X)_{\mathbb Q}$ are called the *Betti-numbers* of $X$.
Since the pairings

$N^k(X)_{\mathbb Q}\times N^{\dim(X)-c}(X)_{\mathbb Q}\rightarrow N^{\dim(X)}(X)_{\mathbb Q} \overset{\cong}\longrightarrow \mathbb Q$

are nondegenerate by the definition of numerical equivalence, we have $\beta_k = \beta_{\dim(X)-k}$ for each $k$.

!!! note
    In this chapter, we abuse our notation in that the name *Chow ring* always refers to a ring of type $N^\ast(X)_{\mathbb Q}$.

With respect to computations, again following `Schubert`, our approach is abstract in the
sense that we do not work with explicit varieties given by equations. Instead, we specify the
dimension of the variety together with its Chow ring and, possibly, further data. We refer to such
a collection of data as an *abstract variety*, and to results obtained from manipulating
the data as results which apply to all (smooth projective complex) varieties sharing the data.

Of particular interest is the tangent bundle of a variety (the Todd class of the
tangent bundle enters the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula). As with any other vector bundle,
the tangent bundle is represented as a collection of data referred to as an *abstract vector bundle*.
The main data here is the Chern character of the vector bundle.

In the same spirit, we introduce  *abstract variety maps*. Their key data is the pullback
morphism between the respective Chow rings.

Some comments on this set-up are in order:

Let $X$ be a variety. Write $K^{\circ}(X)$  for the *Grothendieck group of vector bundles on $X$*. That is,
$K^{\circ} (X)$ is the free abelian group generated by the isomorphy classes of vector bundles on $X$,
modulo the relations of type $[E]=[E^{\prime}]-[E^{\prime \prime}]$, where $E$, $E^\prime$, and
$ E^{\prime \prime}$ fit into an exact sequence
$0\rightarrow E^\prime \rightarrow E \rightarrow E^{\prime \prime} \rightarrow 0$.
The tensor product turns $K^{\circ}(X)$ into a ring,  the *Grothendieck ring of vector bundles on $X$*.
By Riemann-Roch, the Chern character defines a ring isomorphism $\text{ch}: K^{\circ}(X)_{\mathbb Q}
\overset{\simeq}\longrightarrow A^*(X) _{\mathbb Q}$, where $A^*(X)$ is obtained by considering cycles
modulo rational equivalence. Since rational equivalence is (much) finer than
numerical equivalence, we obtain a ring epimorphism

$\text{ch}: K^{\circ}(X)_{\mathbb Q}
\overset{\simeq}\longrightarrow A^*(X) _{\mathbb Q}\twoheadrightarrow N^*(X)_{\mathbb Q}.$

!!! note
    Write $K_{\circ} (X)$  for the *Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves on $X$*.
    Then, since $X$ is supposed to be smooth, the natural map $K^{\circ} (X)\rightarrow K_{\circ} (X)$ is an isomorphism
    (every coherent sheaf on $X$ has a finite resolution by locally free sheaves). We may, thus, speak of coherent sheaves
    given by *virtual vector bundles*, that is, by elements of $K^{\circ} (X)$. Hence,  we can use the concept of abstract
    vector bundles also to infer information on coherent sheaves, with algebraic operations such as `-` or `*` (tensor product)
    being virtual.

!!! note
    In many cases, we won't be able to compute the entire Chow ring. To put it in another way, in these cases, the general methods will only
    yield information on a certain subring of the Chow ring generated by some tautological classes. Then, we are actually working
    with the class of all varieties sharing the same piece of tautological ring (and, possibly, further data). We illustrate this in
    [Example: Cubic surfaces](@ref).

!!! note
    For some nice varieties, numerical equivalence coincides with rational equivalence. For such a variety $X$, the Chow ring
    coincides with the rational cohomology ring and can be completely computed, so problems as in the previous note disappear.
	A nice consequence is that the Betti numbers of $X$ introduced above are exactly the (even) Betti numbers
    of $X$ considered as a compact complex manifold, so we have an equality `sum(betti_numbers(X)) == euler_number(X)`.
    The class of such varieties $X$ includes projective spaces, Grassmannians, homogeneous spaces for affine algebraic
    groups (for example, flag varieties), and in general any variety with an affine stratification. Moreover, products,
    projective bundles, flag bundles, and blowups with center in this class will remain in this class. As Eisenbud and Harris
	[EH16](@cite) put it: *This class represents a tiny fraction of all varieties, but a large fraction of the set of varieties on which
	we can effectively carry out intersection theory.* In OSCAR, internally, we use `set_attribute(X, :alg => true)` to declare that
	$X$  satisfies this property. Accordingly, entering `get_attribute(X, :alg)` reveals whether `:alg` has been set to true or not.
