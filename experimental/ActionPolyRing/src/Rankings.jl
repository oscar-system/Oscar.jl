# For a ranking of jet variables, e.g. u1[123], u3[041], ... one needs:
# - An ordering to compare the elementary symbols u_1, ..., u_n
# - An ordering of the multiindices (this is like a monomial_ordering)
# - A decision on which of the two has priority, e.g. position-over-term (pot)
#   or term-over-position (top). Here, the position of the jet variable corresponding
#   to (i, [a_1, ..., a_n]) is the first coordinate, i.e. i.
