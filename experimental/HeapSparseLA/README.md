# Sparse linear algebra over rings

## Aims

This package explores the possibilities to use heap-based data structures 
for sparse linear algebra over various rings. The hope is to eventually 
improve Gauss-like algorithms for simplifications of matrices and 
complexes of modules.

## Status

An experimental version of the data types and the functionality has been 
implemented. It does not perform too well, yet. As a benchmark one can use 
the methods of `upper_triangular_form!`. See the documentation for details.
