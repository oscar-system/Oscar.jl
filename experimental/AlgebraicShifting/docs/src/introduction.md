# Introduction

Algebraic shifting is a widely applicable method for converting a uniform hypergraph $S$ into another hypergraph, $\Delta(S)$, which is somehow simpler but still retains key properties of $S$.
Often this is applied to simplicial complexes, where each layer of $(k-1)$-faces forms a $k$-uniform hypergraph.

Here we focus on full and partial algebraic shifting in the exterior algebra.
For general background on the subject we refer to [Kal02](@cite); for details concerning the implementation see [D-VJL24](@cite).
