# Algebraic Shifting

## Aims

This package grew out of an ongoing project of Antony Della Vecchia, Michael Joswig and Fabian Lenzen on [Partial Algebraic Shifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24044).
Part of this project is the development of new methods for algebraic shifting; these are implemented here.

## Status

Full and partial shifting in the exterior algebra fully functional.
