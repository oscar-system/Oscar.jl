#---------------------- MAIN FUNCTION ----------------------

# Returns 2 components: ExtAlg, list of the gens/variables

# DEVELOPER DOC
#   This impl is "inefficient": it must create essentially 2 copies of
#   the exterior algebra.  One copy is so that Oscar knows the structure
#   of the ext alg (as a quotient of a PBWAlg); the other copy is a
#   Singular implementation (seen as a "black box" by Oscar) which
#   actually does the arithmetic (quickly).
#
#   To make this work I had to make changes to struct PBWAlgQuo: (see the source)
#   (*) previously a PBWAlgQuo had a single datum, namely the (2-sided) ideal
#       used to make the quotient -- the base ring could be derived from the ideal
# 
#   (*) now a PBWAlgQuo has an extra data field "sring" which refers to
#       the underlying Singular ring structure which actually performs
#       the arithmetic.  For exterior algebras "sring" refers to a
#       specific Singular ring "exteriorAlgebra"; in other cases "sring"
#       refers to the Singular(plural) ring which implements the PBW alg
#       (i.e. IGNORING the fact that the elems are in a quotient)

#   PBWAlgQuoElem did not need to change.  Its "data" field just refers
#   to a PBWAlgElem (namely some representative of the class).

    exterior_algebra(K::Ring, nvars::Int)
    exterior_algebra(K::Ring, varnames::AbstractVector{<:VarName})

Given a coefficient ring `K` and variable names, say `varnames = [:x1, :x2, ...]`,
return a tuple `E, [x1, x2, ...]` consisting of the exterior algebra `E` over
the polynomial ring `R[x1, x2, ...]` and its generators `x1, x2, ...`.

If `K` is a field, this function will use a special implementation in Singular.

!!! note
    Creating an `exterior_algebra` with many variables will create an object
    occupying a lot of memory (probably cubic in `nvars`).

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> E, (x1,x2)  =  exterior_algebra(QQ, 2);

julia> x2*x1
-x1*x2

julia> (x1+x2)^2  # over fields, result is automatically reduced!
0

julia> E, (x,y)  =  exterior_algebra(QQ, ["x","y"]);

julia> y*x
-x*y
```
