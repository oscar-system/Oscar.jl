# Introduction

This package provides methods for calculations with certain translation surfaces called origamis. An origami
(also known as square-tiled surface) is a finite covering of a torus which is ramified at most over one point.
It can be described in the following way from two permutations $\sigma_x, \sigma_y \in S_d$. We take $d$
squares $Q_1, \dots, Q_d$ and glue the upper side of $Q_i$ to the lower side of $Q_{\sigma_y(i)}$ and the
right side of $Q_i$ to the left side of $Q_{\sigma_x(i)}$ . We require origamis to be connected and thus the
group generated by $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$ acts transitively on $\{1, \dots, d\}$. In this package we
identify an origami with a pair of permutations, which acts transitively on $\{1, \dots, d\}$ up to
simultaneous conjugation. This corresponds to renumbering the squares. By choosing a certain numbering in a
canonical way one can achieve a canonical representative.

We are especially interested in the so-called Veech group of an origami. This is a finite-index subgroup of
$\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ which carries a lot of information about the geometric and dynamic properties of the
underlying translation surface. For further information about origamis and translation surfaces in general,
see e.g. [Zmi11](@cite), [Sch05](@cite), [HL06](@cite), [Ran12](@cite) and [Zor06](@cite).
