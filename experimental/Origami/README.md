# An example template for the experimental section

## Aims

This is an example for a file structure to set up a new package 
in the experimental section. All files you find here are part of the 
minimum requirements. See also the official Oscar documentation.

## Status

We plan to also provide a function to automatically copy this template 
for you to start your own package.
