# Monoid Algebras
Monoid algebras generalize $\mathbb{Z}^d$-graded polynomial rings. We call a finitely generated submonoid of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ an affine semigroup. Let $Q$ be an affine semigroup and $k$ some field. The semigroup ring $k[Q]$ is the $k$-algebra
with $k$-basis $\{t^a \colon a \in Q\}$ and multiplication

$t^at^b = t^{a+b} \text{ for }a,b \in Q.$

The affine semigroup of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ generated by the unit vectors $e_1,\dots,e_d$ is the affine semigroup $\mathbb{N}^d$. The corresponding semigroup ring is the polynomial ring

$k[\mathbb{N}^d] = k[x_1,\dots,x_d]$

with $\deg(x_i) = e_i$.  

## Types
Monoid algebras in OSCAR have the parametrized form `MonoidAlgebra{k,A}`, with elements of type `MonoidAlgebraElem{k,A}`. Here, `T` is either of type `MPolyRing{k}` or `MPolyQuoRing{k}` and k is some field.

## Data associated to Monoid Algebras
Let `kQ` be a $\mathbb{Z}^d$-graded monoid algebra. Then

- `kQ.algebra` refers to the monoid algebra as a quotient ring $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]/I_L$,

## Constructor

### From lattice points in $\mathbb{Z}^d$
Given $v_1,\dots,v_n\in \mathbb{Z^d}$, let $Q$ be the submonoid of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ generated by $v_1,\dots,v_n$.

### From quotients of multivariate polynomial rings

## Ideals over Monoid Algebras

### Irreducible decomposition
Given an ideal $I\subseteq k[Q]$, an irreducible decomposition consists of irreducible ideals $W_1,\dots,W_s$ such that

$I = W_1 \cap \cdots \cap W_s.$

## Tests on Monoid Algebras
Check if the Monoid Algebra is normal.
