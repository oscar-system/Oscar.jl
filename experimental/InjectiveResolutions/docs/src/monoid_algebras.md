# Monoid Algebras
Monoid algebras generalize $\mathbb{Z}^d$-graded polynomial rings. We call a finitely generated submonoid of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ an *affine semigroup*. Let $Q$ be an affine semigroup and $k$ some field. The *monoid algebra $k[Q]$* is the $k$-algebra
with $k$-basis $\{t^a \colon a \in Q\}$ and multiplication

$t^at^b = t^{a+b} \text{ for }a,b \in Q.$

The affine semigroup generated by the unit vectors $e_1,\dots,e_d \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ is the affine semigroup $\mathbb{N}^d$. The corresponding monoid algebra is the polynomial ring

$k\left[\mathbb{N}^d\right] = k[x_1,\dots,x_d]$

with $\deg(x_i) = e_i$.  

## Types
Monoid algebras in OSCAR have the parametrized form `MonoidAlgebra{k,A}`, with elements of type `MonoidAlgebraElem{k,A}`. Here, `A` is either of type `MPolyRing` or `MPolyQuoRing` and `k` is some field.

## Data associated to Monoid Algebras
Let `kQ` = $k[Q]$ be a monoid algebra over a monoid $Q\subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d$. Then `kQ.algebra` refers to the monoid algebra as a quotient ring of the finely graded polynomial ring $k[x_1,\dots,x_d]$. 

To every monoid algebra $k[Q]$, we associate a polyhedral cone

$C = \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}Q.$

```@docs
cone(A::MonoidAlgebra)
```

There is a correspondence between the homogeneous primes of the monoid algebra $k[Q]$ and the faces $F$ of $C$

$F \mapsto k\{Q\setminus F\}.$

### Example
```jldoctest
julia> kQ = monoid_algebra([[0,1],[1,1],[1,2]],QQ)
monoid algebra over rational field with cone of dimension 2


julia> kQ.algebra
Quotient
  of multivariate polynomial ring in 3 variables over QQ graded by
    x_1 -> [0 1]
    x_2 -> [1 1]
    x_3 -> [1 2]
  by ideal (x_1*x_2 - x_3)

julia> cone(kQ)

julia> faces(kQ)
4-element Vector{Oscar.InjectiveResolutions.FaceQ}:

 face corresponding to homogeneous prime ideal ()
```

## Constructor
Let $v_1,\dots,v_n$ in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ be the generators of a monoid $Q$. The corresponding monoid algebra is

$k[Q] \cong k[x^{v_1},\dots,x^{v_n}]\subseteq k[x_1,\dots, x_d].$

```

## Irreducible decomposition
Given an ideal $I\subseteq k[Q]$, an irreducible decomposition consists of irreducible ideals $W_1,\dots,W_s\subseteq k[Q]$ such that

$I = W_1 \cap \cdots \cap W_s.$

## Tests on Monoid Algebras
Check if a monoid algebra is normal.
