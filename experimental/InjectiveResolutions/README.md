# Local Cohomology over monoid algebras

## Aims

This experimental package provides tools to compute injective resolutions and local cohomology modules of finitely generated modules over monoid algebras. It implements the algorithms in [HM05](@cite). 

## Status

We have implemented algorithms to compute injective resolutions and local cohomology for normal monoid algebras.
