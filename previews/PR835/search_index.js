The code can be initially placed in a src/Misc directory in AbstractAlgebra or Nemo until it can finally be integrated fully into the correct place in those projects.\nSome of the code calls full parent object constructors in generic code. Such calls should be removed where possible.\nSome functions such as exp and the like require Base to be prepended, as we do not import these functions from Base into Generic.\nSome of the code calls back into convenience functions found only in Hecke. These have to be rewritten in terms of AbstractAlgebra/Nemo functions.\nSome of the code relies on fmpz being available, but would otherwise be suitable for AbstractAlgebra. This code can hopefully be rewritten to be agnostic about the integer type.\nTodos, questions and so on should be moved to tickets.\nSometimes exception types differ between Hecke and Nemo, meaning that tests will fail due to the wrong type of exception being raised. Either the tests will have to be adjusted, or the Nemo exception types changed.\nRingElem is often used where RingElement is intended, etc. Also types are often unconstrained where Nemo would constrain them to RingElement.\nSome Hecke functions try to support generic types and specific concrete Nemo types in the same implementation. These will unfortunately have to either be split between AbstractAlgebra and Nemo or a completely generic implementation for abstract types will have to be made.\nSome Hecke implementations assume sub! and friends are available in generic code. These will have to be rewritten, usually by adding a single unary minus outside of a loop and switching to add! and friends inside the loops.\nTest code, docstrings and documentation will have to be added where they do not already exist.\nExports of the new functionality will have to be added.\nSome functions should be accompanied by similar functions that don't yet exist.

See the specific documentation for the module of interest to see details.\nzero and one : these are implemented for parent types, which is not what Julia typically expects. Exceptions include the Flint fmpz and fmpq types, as their parents are not parameterised, which makes it possible to implement these functions for the types as well as the parents.\nrand : we have a Nemo specific rand interface, which passes the tail of a given rand invocation to the rand function for the base ring, e.g. to create random matrix elements or polynomial coefficients and so on. In addition to this custom rand interface, we also support much of the Julia rand interface, with the usual caveat that we use parent objects instead of types where necessary.\nserialisation : unfortunately this is currently NOT implemented by Nemo, but we would certainly like to see that done in the future. It's not automatic because of the C objects that underly many of our constructions.\nNumber : Nemo number types do NOT belong to Julia's Number hierarchy, as we must make all our ring element types belong to our RingElem abstract type. To make some Julia Number types cooperate with Nemo, we define the unions RingElement and FieldElement which include some Julia types, such as BigInt and Rational{BigInt}, etc. Note that fixed precision integer types cannot be expected to be well-behaved when they overflow. We recommend using Nemo integer types if one wants good performance for small machine word sized integers, but no overflow when the integer becomes large (Nemo integers are based on Flint's multiprecision fmpz type).\nhash : we implement hash functions for all major element types in Nemo.\ngetindex/setindex!/typed_hvcat : we implement these to access elements of Nemo matrices, however see the note below on row major representation. In  addition, we allow creation of matrices using the notation R[a b; c d] etc. This is done by overloading typed_hvcat for the parent object R instead of a type as Julia would normally expect.
