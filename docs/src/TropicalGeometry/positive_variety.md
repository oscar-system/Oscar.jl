# Positive tropicalizations of linear ideals

## Introduction
Positive tropial varieties (in OSCAR) are weighted polyhedral complexes and as per the definition in [SW05](@cite).  They may arise as tropicalizations of polynomial ideals over an ordered field.  Currently, the only ideals supported are linear ideals over rational numbers or rational function fields over rational numbers.
