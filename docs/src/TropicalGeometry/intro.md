# Introduction
The tropical geometry part of OSCAR provides functionality for
- tropical min-plus and max-plus semirings,
- matrices and polynomials thereover,
- tropical varieties, hypersurfaces, curves, and linear spaces.


General textbooks offering details on theory and algorithms include:
- Maclagan, Sturmfels: Introduction to Tropical Geometry [MS15](@cite)
- Joswig: Essentials of Tropical Combinatorics [Jos21](@cite)

Like [MS15](@cite), OSCAR follows the min-convention by default and unless specified otherwise.
