# Invariants of Finite Groups

In this section, with notation as in the introduction to this chapter, $G$ will be a *finite* group.

!!! note
     The ssumption that $G$ is finite implies:
     - By a result of Emmy Noether, $K[V]$ is integral over $K[V]^G$. In particular,

          $\; \; \; \; \; \dim K[V]^G = \dim K[V] = n.$
         
         Moreover, $K[V]^G$ is finitely generated as a $K$-algebra.
		   
    - If the group order $|G|$ is invertible in $K$, then we have the explicit Reynolds operator

       $\; \; \; \; \; \mathcal R: K[V] \to K[V], f\mapsto \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{\pi\in G}(f \;\!   . \;\! \pi).$

!!! note
    We speak of *non-modular* invariant theory if $|G|$ is invertible in $K$, and of *modular* invariant theory otherwise.

!!! note
    In the non-modular case, using  Emmy Noether's result and the Reynolds operator, it is not too difficult to show that $K[V]^G$ is a free module over any of its graded Noether normalizations. That is, $K[V]^G$ is Cohen-Macaulay. In the modular case, $K[V]^G$ may not be Cohen-Macaulay.

!!! note
    In the non-modular case, the Hilbert series of $K[V]^G$ can be precomputed as its Molien series. See [DK15](@cite) and [DJ98](@cite) for explicit formulas.

Knowing the Hilbert series means to know the dimension of each graded piece $K[V]^G_d$. This information can often be used to speed up algorithms for finding invariants.
The most basic task here is to compute the invariants of  some given degree $d$, that is, to find  an explicit $K$-basis of $K[V]^G_d$. There are two different approaches:

- The *Reynolds Operator Method*, available in  the non-modular case, applies the Reynolds operator to sufficiently many monomials in $K[x_1, \dots, x_n]_d\cong K[V]_d$,  and extracts a $K$-basis from the resulting generating set.
- The *Linear Algebra Method*, available in the non-modular and the modular case, finds the elements of a $K$-basis all at once by setting up and solving an appropriate $K$-linear system of equations.

These methods are, in particular, crucial to the computation of primary and secondary invariants. Primary invariants and irreducible secondary invariants together generate $K[V]^G$ as a $K$-algebra. Omitting redundant generators yields a system of fundamental invariants.
In the non-modular case, an alternative and typically more effective way to compute generators of $K[V]^G$ is King's algorithm which finds a system of fundamental invariants directly, without computing primary and secondary invariants. See [Kin13](@cite).

We discuss the relevant OSCAR functionality below.

## Creating Invariant Rings

### How Groups are Given

The invariant theory part of OSCAR  distinguishes two ways of how  finite groups and their actions on $K[x_1, \dots, x_n]\cong K[V]$ are specified:

#### Matrix Groups

Here, $G$ will be explicitly given as a matrix group $G\subset \text{GL}_n(K)\cong \text{GL}(V) $ by (finitely many) generating matrices, acting on $K[x_1, \dots, x_n]\cong K[V]$ by linear substitution:

$(f \;\!   . \;\! \pi)  (x_1, \dots, x_n)  = f((x_1, \dots, x_n) \cdot \rho(\pi)) \text{ for all } \pi\in G.$

#### Permutation Groups

Here, $G$ will be given as a permutation group, acting on $K[x_1, \dots, x_n]\cong K[V]$ by permuting the variables.

## Basic Data Associated to Invariant Rings

If `IR` is the invariant ring $K[x_1,..., x_n]^G$ of a finite matrix group $G$, then

- `group(IR)` refers to $G$,
- `coefficient_ring(IR)` to $K$, and
- `polynomial_ring(IR)` to $K[x_1,..., x_n]$.

Moreover, `is_modular(IR)` returns `true` in the modular case, and
`false` otherwise.
