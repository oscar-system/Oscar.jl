# Invariants of Tori
In this section, with notation as in the [introduction](@ref invariant_theory) to this chapter, $T =(K^{\ast})^m$ will be a torus of rank $m$
over a field $K$. To compute invariants of diagonal torus actions, OSCAR makes use of Algorithm 4.3.1  in [DK15](@cite) which,
in particular, relies on algorithmic means from polyhedral geometry.
