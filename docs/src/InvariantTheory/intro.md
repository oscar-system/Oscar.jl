# Introduction

The invariant theory part of OSCAR provides functionality for computing polynomial invariants
of group actions.

The basic setting in this context consists of a group $G$, a field $K$, a vector space
$V$ over $K$ of finite dimension $n,$ and  a representation $\rho: G \to \text{GL}(V)$ of $G$ on $V$.
The induced action on the dual vector space $V^\ast$,

$G \times V^\ast \rightarrow V^\ast, (\pi,f)\mapsto \pi \;\!  . \;\!  f := f\circ \rho(\pi^{-1}),$
 
extends to an action of $G$ on the graded symmetric algebra

$K[V]:=S(V^*)=\bigoplus_{d\geq 0} S^d V^*$

which preserves the grading.

The *invariants* of $G$ are the fixed points of this action, its *ring of invariants* is the graded subalgebra

$K[V]^G:=\{f\in K[V] \mid \pi  \;\!  . \;\!  f=f {\text { for any }} \pi\in G\} \subset K[V].$

Explicitly, the choice of a basis of $V$ and its dual basis, say, $\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$ of $V^*$
gives rise to isomorphisms $\text{GL}(V) \cong \text{GL}_n(K)$ and $K[V]\cong  K[x_1, \dots, x_n]$.
After identifying $\text{GL}(V)$ with $\text{GL}_n(K)$ and $K[V]$ with $K[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ by means of
these isomorphisms, the action of $G$ on $K[V]$ is given as follows:

$(\pi \;\!  . \;\!  f) \;\! (x_1, \dots, x_n)  = f(\rho(\pi^{-1}) \cdot (x_1, \dots, x_n)^T).$

Accordingly, $K[V]^G$ may be regarded as a graded subalgebra of $K[x_1, \dots, x_n]$:

$K[V]^G \cong K[x_1, \dots, x_n]^G :=\{f\in K[x_1, \dots, x_n] \mid \pi  \;\!  . \;\!  f=f {\text { for any }} \pi\in G\}.$

!!! note
    If $K[V]^G$ is finitely generated as a $K$-algebra, then any minimal system of homogeneous generators is called a *fundamental system of invariants* of $K[V]^G$. By Nakayama's lemma, the number of elements in such a system is uniquely determined as the embedding dimension of $K[V]^G$. Similarly, the degrees of these elements are uniquely determined.

!!! note
     If $K[V]^G$ is finitely generated as a $K$-algebra, then $K[V]^G$ admits a graded Noether normalization, that is, a Noether normalization $K[p_1, \dots, p_m] \subset K[V]^G$ with $p_1, \dots, p_m$ homogeneous. Given any such Noether normalization, $p_1, \dots, p_m$ is called a system of *primary invariants* of $K[V]^G$, and  any minimal system $s_0=1, s_1,\dots, s_l$ of homogeneous generators of $K[V]^G$ as a $K[p_1, \dots, p_m]$-module is called a system of *secondary invariants* of $K[V]^G$ with respect to $p_1, \dots, p_m$.

!!! note
    In all situations considered in this chapter, theoretical results will guarantee that $K[V]^G$ is finitely generated as a $K$-algebra. In addition, if not mentioned otherwise, the following will hold:
    - There exists a Reynolds operator $\mathcal R: K[V] \to K[V]$. That is, $\mathcal R$ is a $K$-linear graded map which projects $K[V]$ onto $K[V]^G$, and which is a $K[V]^G$-module homomorphism.
    - The ring $K[V]^G$ is Cohen-Macaulay. Equivalently, $K[V]^G$ is a free module (of finite rank) over any of its graded Noether normalizations.
