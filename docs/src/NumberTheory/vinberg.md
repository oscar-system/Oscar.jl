# Vinberg's algorithm

 A *Lorentzian lattice* $L$ is an integral $\Z$-lattice of signature $(s_+, s_-)$ with $s_+=1$ and $s_->0$. 
 A *root* of $r \in L$ is a primitive vector s.t. reflection in the hyperplane $r^\perp$ maps $L$ to itself.
 Let $W(L)\leq O(L)$ be the Weyl group, that is the group generated by reflections in the root hyperplanes of $L$. 
 We say that $L$ is *reflective* if $W(L)$ is of finite index in $O(L)$. 
 For $x,y \in L$ we write $x.y:=\Phi(x,y)$ and $x^2:=\Phi(x,x)$ for the symmetric bilinear form in $L$.
   
 See for example [Tur18](@cite) for the theory of Arithmetic Reflection Groups and Reflective Lorentzian Lattices.

## Description 
 Vinberg's algorithm constructs a fundamental polyhedron $P$ for a Lorentzian lattice $L$ by computing its *fundamental roots* $r$, i.e. the roots $r$ which are perpendicular to the faces of $P$ and which have inner product at least 0 with the elements of $P$.
 Choose $v_0$ in $L$ primitive with $v_0^2 > 0$ as a point that $P$ should contain.

 Let $Q$ be the Gram matrix of $L$ with respect to some basis. A vector $r$ is a fundamental root, if
 - the vector $r$ is primitive,
 - reflection by $r$ preserves the lattice, i.e. $\frac{2}{r^2} r Q$ is an integer matrix,
 - the pair $(r, v_0)$ is positive oriented, i.e. $r. v_0 > 0$,
 - the product $r. \~{r} \geq \ 0$ for all roots $\~{r}$ already found.
 This implies that $r^2$ divides $2 i$ for $i$ being the level of $Q$, i.e. the last invariant of the Smith normal form of $Q$. 

 $P$ can be constructed by solving $r.v_0 = n$ and $r^2 = k$ by increasing order of the value $\frac{n^2}{k}$ and $r$ satisfying the above conditions.

 If $v_0$ lies on a root hyperplane, then $P$ is not uniquely determined.
 In that case we need a direction vector $v_1$ which satisfies $\~{v}. v_1 \neq 0$ 
 for all possible roots $\~{v}$ with $v_0. \~{v} = 0$  

 With $v_0$ and $v_1$ fixed $P$ is uniquely determined for any choice of root lengths and maximal distance $v_0.r$.
 We choose the first roots $r$ by increasing order of the value $\frac{\~{r}. v_1}{r^2}$ for all possible roots $\~{v}$ with $v_0. \~{v} = 0$.
 For any other root length we continue as stated above.
 
 For proofs of the statements above and further explanations see [Vin75](@cite).
