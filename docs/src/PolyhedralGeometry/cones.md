# Cones


## Introduction

Let $\mathbb{F}$ be an ordered field; the default is that
$\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{Q}$ is the field of rational numbers.

A set $C \subseteq \mathbb{F}^n$ is called a *(polyhedral) cone* if it can be
written as the set of non-negative linear combinations of finitely many vectors
in $\mathbb{F}^n$.  Equivalently, cones can be written as the intersection of
finitely many homogeneous linear inequalities.

Any cone is a special case of a polyhedron.  Conversely, intersecting a cone
with a suitable affine hyperplane yields a polyhedron whose faces are in
bijection with the faces of the cone.  Going back and forth between polyhedra
and their homogenizations, the cones, is a frequent operation.  This is one
reason for keeping cones as a distinct type.
