## [Elements of groups](@id elements_of_groups)

Given a group `G`, it is always possible to have access to some particular elements.

```@docs
GAPGroup
BasicGAPGroupElem{T<:GAPGroup}
elem_type(::Type{T}) where T
one(x::GAPGroup)
one(x::GAPGroupElem)
gens(::GAPGroup)
ngens(G::GAPGroup)
gen(::GAPGroup, i::Int)
rand(::GAPGroup)
rand_pseudo(G::GAPGroup)
```

It is also possible to obtain the generators of `G` by typing
```julia
f1,f2,f3 = gens(G)
```
This is equivalent to
```julia
f1=G[1]; f2=G[2]; f3=G[3];
```
If the group `G` has been created as the subgroup of another group generated by a list of elements `L`, then the generating set returned by the function `gens` corresponds to `L`.

!!! note
    The output of `gens(G)` is not, in general, the minimal list of generators for `G`.

## Operations

Oscar supports the following operations and functions on group elements.

* `*` = multiplication between two elements in a group.
* `inv(x)` = ``x^{-1}`` the inverse of `x`.
* `x/y` = the element ``xy^{-1}``.
* `x^n` = the ``n``-th power of `x`. If ``n = 0``, the identity of the group is returned; if ``n < 0 ``, the ``-n``-th power of the inverse of `x` is returned.
* `isone(x)`: returns whether `x` is the identity of the group.
* `conj(x,y)` = `x^y` = the conjugate of `x` by `y`, i.e. the element ``y^{-1}xy``.
* `comm(x,y)` = the commutator of `x` and `y`, i.e. the element ``x^{-1}y^{-1}xy``.

!!! note
    In Oscar, the expression `x^y^z` is equivalent to `x^(y^z)`. In other words, conjugations are evaluated from the right to the left.
