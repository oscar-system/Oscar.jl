## Perfect groups of small order

The functions in this section are wrappers for the GAP library of finite perfect
groups which provides, up to isomorphism, a list of all perfect groups whose
sizes are less than $2\cdot 10^6$. The groups of most orders up to $10^6$ have been
enumerated by Derek Holt and Wilhelm Plesken, see [HP89](@cite). For orders
$n = 86016$, 368640, or 737280 this work only counted the groups (but did not
explicitly list them), the groups of orders $n = 61440$, 122880, 172032,
245760, 344064, 491520, 688128, or 983040 were omitted.

Several additional groups omitted from the book [HP89](@cite) have also
been included. Two groups -- one of order 450000 with a factor group of
type $A_6$ and the one of order 962280 -- were found by Jack Schmidt in
2005. Two groups of order 243000 and one each of orders 729000, 871200, 878460
were found in 2020 by Alexander Hulpke.

The perfect groups of size less than $2\cdot 10^6$ which had not been
classified in the work of Holt and Plesken have been enumerated by Alexander
Hulpke. They are stored directly and provide less construction information
in their names.

As all groups are stored by presentations, a permutation representation
is obtained by coset enumeration. Note that some of the library groups do
not have a faithful permutation representation of small degree.
Computations in these groups may be rather time consuming.

## Atlas of Group Representations

The functions in this section give access to data in the
Atlas of Group Representations [WWTSPNNLBA](@cite).
The isomorphism types of the groups in question are specified via
names for the groups, which coincide with the names of the
corresponding character tables in the library of character tables,
see [`character_table(id::String, p::Int = 0)`](@ref).
