## Grassman Plücker Ideal

The Grassman Plücker Ideal is the homogenous ideal generated by the relations defined by 
the Plücker Embedding of the Grassmanian. That is given $\text{Gr}\(k, n\)$ the Moduli 
Space of all $k$-dimensional subspaces of an $n$-dimensional vector space, the relations
are given by all $d \times d$ minors of a $d \times n$ matrix. For the algorithm see
[Stu93](@cite).
