# Projective Varieties
A projective variety over an algebraically closed field
is an irreducible projective algebraic set. See [Projective Algebraic Sets](@ref).

In practice we work over non-closed fields. To be called a variety
an algebraic set $V$ must stay irreducible when viewed over the algebraic closure.

In Oscar projective varieties are [Projective schemes](@ref) and more formally defined as follows.
