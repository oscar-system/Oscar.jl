# Nongeneral Type Surfaces in $\mathbb P^4$

Every smooth, projective surface can be embedded in $\mathbb P^5$, but there are constraints
on the numerical invariants of a smooth surface in $\mathbb P^4$: The invariants of each such
surface $S$ satisfy the double point formula

$d^2-5d-10(\pi-1)+2(\chi(\mathcal O_S)-K_S^2) = 0.$

Here, $d$ is the degree of $S$, $\pi$ its sectional genus, $\chi(\mathcal O_S)$ its Euler-Poincare
characteristic, and $K_S$ its canonical class.
The double point  formula is a key ingredient in the proof of a
theorem of Ellingsrud and Peskine which states that there are only finitely many families of
smooth surfaces in $\mathbb P^4$ which are not of general type. That is, the degree of such
surfaces in bounded from above. The best bound known so far is $52$, while
examples exist up to degree $15$.

For details, we refer to
- [DES93](@cite)
- [Pop93](@cite)
- [DS00](@cite)
and the references given there.

Below, we present functions which return one hard coded example for each family presented
in the first two papers above.  Based on these papers, the existence of further families has
been shown. Explicit examples to be included here are under construction.

!!! note
    To ease subsequent computations, all hard coded examples are defined over a finite prime field.
