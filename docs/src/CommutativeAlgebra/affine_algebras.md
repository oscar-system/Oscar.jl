# [Affine Algebras and Their Ideals](@id affine_algebras)

With regard to notation, we use *affine algebra* as a synonym for *quotient of a multivariate polynomial ring by an ideal*.
More specifically, if $R$ is a multivariate polynomial ring with coefficient ring $C$, and $A=R/I$ is the quotient of $R$
by an ideal $I$ of $R$, we refer to $A$ as an *affine algebra over $C$*, or an *affine $C$-algebra*. In this section, we
discuss functionality for handling such algebras in OSCAR.

!!! note
    We emphasize: In this section, we view $R/I$ together with its ring structure. Realizing $R/I$ as an
    $R$-module means to implement it as the quotient of a free $R$-module of rank 1. See the section on [modules](@ref modules_multivariate).

!!! note
    Most functions discussed here rely on Gröbner basis techniques. In particular, they typically make use of a Gröbner basis for the
    modulus of the quotient. Nevertheless, the construction of quotients is lazy in the sense that the computation of such a Gröbner
    basis is delayed until the user performs an operation that indeed requires it. The Gröbner basis is then computed with respect
    to the monomial ordering entered by the user when creating the quotient; if no ordering is entered, OSCAR will use the
	`default_ordering` on the underlying polynomial ring. See the section on [Gröbner/Standard Bases](@ref gb_fields) for default orderings in OSCAR.
	Once computed, the Gröbner basis is cached for later reuse.

!!! note
    Recall that Gröbner basis methods are implemented for multivariate polynomial rings over fields (exact fields supported by
    OSCAR) and, where not indicated otherwise, for multivariate polynomial rings over the integers.

!!! note
    In OSCAR, elements of a quotient $A = R/I$ are not necessarily represented by polynomials which are reduced with regard to $I$.
    That is, if $f\in R$ is the internal polynomial representative of an element of $A$, then $f$ may not be the normal form mod $I$
    with respect to the default ordering on $R$ (see the section on [Gröbner/Standard Bases](@ref gb_fields) for normal forms). Operations involving
    Gröbner basis computations may lead to (partial) reductions. The function `simplify` discussed in this section computes fully
    reduced representatives.

!!! note
    Each grading on a multivariate polynomial ring `R`  in OSCAR  descends to a grading on the affine algebra `A = R/I`
    (recall that OSCAR ideals of graded polynomial rings are required to be homogeneous).
    Functionality for dealing with such gradings and our notation for describing this functionality descend accordingly.
    This applies, in particular, to the functions [`is_graded`](@ref),  [`is_standard_graded`](@ref), [`is_z_graded`](@ref),
    [`is_zm_graded`](@ref), and [`is_positively_graded`](@ref) which will not be discussed again here.

## Types

The OSCAR type for quotients of  multivariate polynomial rings is of parametrized form `MPolyQuoRing{T}`,
with elements of type `MPolyQuoRingElem{T}`. Here, `T` is the element type of the polynomial ring.

## Data Associated to Affine Algebras

### Basic Data

If `A=R/I` is the quotient of a multivariate polynomial ring `R` modulo an ideal `I` of `R`, then

- `base_ring(A)` refers to `R`,
- `modulus(A)` to `I`,
- `gens(A)` to the generators of `A`,
- `number_of_generators(A)` / `ngens(A)` to the number of these generators,
- `gen(A, i)` as well as `A[i]` to the `i`-th such generator, and
- `ordering(A)` to the monomial ordering used in the construction of `A`.

## Elements of Affine Algebras

### Types

The OSCAR type for elements of quotients of  multivariate polynomial rings is of
parametrized form `MPolyQuoRing{T}`, where `T` is the element type of the polynomial ring.

### Creating Elements of Affine Algebras

Elements of an affine algebra `A=R/I` are created as images of elements of `R` under the projection map
or by directly coercing elements of `R` into `A`.

###### Examples

```jldoctest
julia> R, (x, y) = polynomial_ring(QQ, [:x, :y]);

julia> A, p = quo(R, ideal(R, [x^3*y^2-y^3*x^2, x*y^4-x*y^2]));

julia> f = p(x^3*y^2-y^3*x^2+x*y)
x^3*y^2 - x^2*y^3 + x*y

julia> typeof(f)
MPolyQuoRingElem{QQMPolyRingElem}

julia> g = A(x^3*y^2-y^3*x^2+x*y)

## Homomorphisms From Affine Algebras

If $A=R/I$ is an affine $C$-algebra, and $S$ is any ring, then defining a ring homomorphism
$\overline{\phi}: A \to S$ means to define a ring homomorphism $\phi: R \to S$
such that $I\subset \ker(\phi)$. Thus, $\overline{\phi} $ is determined by specifying its restriction
to $C$, and by assigning an image to each generator of $A$.
In OSCAR, such homomorphisms are created as follows:

```@docs
hom(A::MPolyQuoRing, S::NCRing, coeff_map, images::Vector; check::Bool = true)
```

Given a ring homomorphism `F` : `A` $\to$ `S` as above, `domain(F)` and `codomain(F)`
refer to `A` and `S`, respectively.  Given ring homomorphisms `F` : `A` $\to$ `B` and
`G` : `B` $\to$ `T` as above, `compose(F, G)` refers to their composition.

## Homomorphisms of Affine Algebras

The OSCAR homomorphism type `AffAlgHom` models ring homomorphisms `R` $\to$ `S` such that
the types of `R` and `S`  are subtypes of `Union{MPolyRing{T}, MPolyQuoRing{U1}}` and
`Union{MPolyRing{T}, MPolyQuoRing{U2}}`, respectively. Here, `T <: FieldElem` and
`U1 <: MPolyRingElem{T}`, `U2 <: MPolyRingElem{T}`.
Functionality for these homomorphism is discussed in what follows.

## Hilbert Series and Hilbert Polynomial

Given a multivariate polynomial ring $R$ over a field $K$ together with a (multi)grading
on $R$ by a finitely generated abelian group $G$, let $I$ be an ideal of $R$ which is
homogeneous with respect to this grading. Then the affine $K-$algebra $A=R/I$
inherits the grading: $A = \bigoplus_{g\in G} A_g$. Suppose now that $R$ is positively
graded by $G$. That is, $G$ is free and each graded piece $R_g$ has finite dimension.
Then also $A_g$ is a finite dimensional $K$-vector space for each $g$, and we have the
well-defined *Hilbert function* of $A$,

$H(A, \underline{\phantom{d}}): G \to \mathbb{N}, \; g\mapsto \dim_K(A_g).$

The *Hilbert series* of $A$ is the generating function

$H_A(\mathbb t)=\sum_{g\in G} H(A, g) \mathbb t^g$

(see  Section 8.2 in [MS05](@cite) for a formal discussion extending the classical case of
$\mathbb Z$-gradings with positive weights to the more general case of multigradings).
As in the classical case, the infinitely many values of the Hilbert function
can be expressed in finite terms by representing the Hilbert series as a rational function
(see Theorem 8.20 in [MS05](@cite) for a precise statement).

By a result of Macaulay, if $A = R/I$ is an affine algebra, and $L_{>}(I)$ is the leading
ideal of $I$ with respect to a global monomial ordering $>$, then the Hilbert function of $A$
equals that of $R/L_{>}(I)$ (see Theorem 15.26 in [Eis95](@cite)).
Thus, using Gröbner bases, the computation of Hilbert series can be reduced to the case where
the modulus of the affine algebra is a monomial ideal. In the latter case, we face a problem
of combinatorial nature, and there are various strategies of how to proceed (see [KR05](@cite)).
The functions `hilbert_series`, `hilbert_series_reduced`, `hilbert_series_expanded`,
`hilbert_function`, `hilbert_polynomial`, and `degree` address the case of
$\mathbb Z$-gradings with positive weights, relying on corresponding Singular
functionality. The functions `multi_hilbert_series`, `multi_hilbert_series_reduced `,
and `multi_hilbert_function` offer a variety of different strategies and allow one to handle
positive gradings in general.

### $\mathbb Z$-Gradings With Positive Weights

Let $R=K[x_1, \dots x_n]$ be a polynomial ring in $n$ variables over a field $K$.
Assign positive integer weights $w_i$ to the variables $x_i$, and grade
$R=\bigoplus_{d\in \mathbb Z} R_d=\bigoplus_{d\geq 0} R_d$ according
to the corresponding weighted degree. Let $I$ be an
ideal of $R$ which is homogeneous with respect to this
grading. Then the affine $K$-algebra $A=R/I$ inherits the grading:
$A = \bigoplus_{d\geq 0} A_d$, where each graded piece $A_d$ is a finite dimensional
$K$-vector space. In this situation, the *Hilbert function* of $A$ is
of type

$H(A, \underline{\phantom{d}}): \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}, \;d \mapsto \dim_K(d),$

and the *Hilbert series* of $A$ is the formal power series

$H_A(t)=\sum_{d\geq 0} H(A, d) t^d\in\mathbb Z[[t]].$

The Hilbert series can be written as a rational function $p(t)/q(t)$, with denominator

$q(t) = (1-t^{w_1})\cdots (1-t^{w_n}).$

In the standard $\mathbb Z$-graded case, where the weights on the variables are all 1, the Hilbert function is of polynomial nature: There exists
 a unique polynomial $P_A(t)\in\mathbb{Q}[t]$, the *Hilbert polynomial*, which satisfies $H(M,d)=P_M(d)$
for all $d \gg 0$. Furthermore, the *degree* of $A$ is defined as the dimension of $A$ over $K$ if this dimension
is finite, and as the integer $d$ such that the leading term of the Hilbert polynomial has the form $d t^e/e!$, otherwise.
