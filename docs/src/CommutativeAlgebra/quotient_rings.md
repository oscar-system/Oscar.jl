# Quotient Rings of Polynomial Rings

We discuss functionality for working with quotient rings of multivariate polynomial rings which may or may not have an assigned grading.

## Constructor

```@docs
quo(R::MPolyRing, I::MPolyIdeal)
```

!!! note
    With or without an assigned grading, the return types of `quo` are  subtypes of `MPolyQuo`.

!!! note
    In Oscar, elements of quotient rings are not necessarily reduced with regard to the modulus of the quotient ring.
    Operations involving Gr√∂bner basis computations may lead to partial reductions. Full reductions, depending on the choice of a monomial ordering, are achieved by explicitly computing normal forms. The functions `simplify` and `simplify!` discussed in the sections below implements this.

## Data Associated to Quotient Rings of Polynomial Rings

### Basic Data

If `Q=R/I` is the quotient of a multivariate polynomial ring `R` modulo an ideal `I` of `R`, then

- `base_ring(Q)` refers to `R`,
- `modulus(Q)` to `I`,
- `gens(Q)` to the generators of `Q`, and
- `ngens(Q)` to the number of these generators.

###### Examples

```@repl oscar
R, (x, y, z) = PolynomialRing(QQ, ["x", "y", "z"])
Q, _ = quo(R, ideal(R, [y-x^2, x-z^3]))
base_ring(Q)
modulus(Q)
gens(Q)
ngens(Q)
```
