# Introduction

The commutative algebra part of OSCAR provides functionality for handling

- ideals of multivariate polynomial rings,
- quotients of multivariate polynomial rings modulo ideals, as well as ideals of such quotients, and 
- modules over the above rings.

In describing this functionality, we will refer to quotients of multivariate polynomial rings also as *affine algebras*.

!!! note
    Most of the functions discussed here rely on Gr√∂bner basis techniques. They are  implemented for multivariate polynomial rings over fields (exact fields supported by OSCAR) and, if not indicated otherwise, for multivariate polynomial rings over the integers.

!!! note
    Multivariate polynomial rings may or may not carry a distinguished grading. For simplicity of the presentation, functions are often only illustrated by examples with focus on the latter case, but work similarly for homogeneous ideals and graded modules in the former case.
