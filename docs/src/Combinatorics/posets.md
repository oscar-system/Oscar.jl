# Partially Ordered Sets

## Introduction

Partially ordered sets (a.k.a. *posets*) describe a finite set of elements with a partial ordering.
All such objects in OSCAR need to have a rank function but it is not required
that it is graded, i.e., adjacent nodes may have a rank difference larger than one.

Internally, posets are encoded in terms of their *Hasse diagrams*.
The latter object is the directed graph whose nodes are the elements, and the oriented edges are given by the covering relations.
Usually, the direction is from bottom to top; but there are exceptions, e.g., due to lazy evaluation.

Posets are static in the sense that they are born once, and then they remain immutable.
This is different from [Graphs](@ref).

!!! note
    Unique maximal and minimal elements are also required but in some cases this is realized by adding an extra
    artificial top node which covers all maximal elements and an artificial top node which is covered by all minimal elements.
    These nodes are suppressed in most functions except for the visualization.
