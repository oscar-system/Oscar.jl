# Phylogenetic Trees

## Introduction

Phylogenetic trees represent the evolutionary history of some species of consideration.
Here we consider phylogenetic (rooted) trees with branch lengths as defined in [SS03](@cite).

The construction of tropical median consensus trees is one of the nontrivial algorithm here.
