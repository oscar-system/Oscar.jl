# Questions, discussion, TODOs

## Grammar
In GAP we recently spent quite some effort to get away from printing things like
`in 1 variables` changing it to `in 1 variable`.
This might seem minor, and programmers like to ignore it, but it sounds quite jarring.
Dealing with this is not rocket science, we have a nice helper in GAP
that semi-automates this for us in 99% of all cases.

### Univariate vs Multivariate:
Since univariate and multivariate rings behave very differently,
we want to distinguish them in supercompact printing:

`Univariate polynomial ring`
`Univariate quotient ring`
`Multivariate polynomial ring`
`Graded multivariate polynomial ring`
`Quotient of multivariate polynomial ring`
`Quotient of graded multivariate polynomial ring` ?


## General comments


## Unicode
Some examples for oneline printing using unicode
```julia
Polynomial ring in 10 variables over ℚ

Polynomial ring in 10 variables over 𝔽₂

Polynomial ring in 10 variables over 𝔽₃₁
```
The spacing of super and subscripts seems to depend on the font.
Here it looks great! But in my terminal it looks really bad.
But setting my font to monospace regular it looks really nice, just like here.
```julia
The hyperplane of ℝ² described by x₂ = 0
```

# Technical aspects

## How julia prints things

There are lots of open issues regarding with the printing in julia.

The important "features" for us are the following:
- `:oneline` is never set when elements of arrays or vectors are printed.
  Only for multi-dimensional arrays.
- The normal `X]enter` command in the REPL will always call `show(::IO, ::MIME"text/plain", X)`
  (which has some fallbacks, but this is the method we should overwrite for our "detailed" version)
- The printing of vector or Tuple elements is handled as follows:
    - If the `::MIME"text/plain"` `show` method contains a newline,
      it will use the `show(::IO, X)` method.
    - If there is no newline, use `show(::IO, ::MIME"text/plain", X)`.

  (This is of course not documented, but see the example below)
- So here is the upshot. Inside a `show(...)` call,
  one can never know if the caller is an array/vector/tuple printing method.
  If our `:detail` version contains no newline, the `:detail` version will also
  be used in array/tuple printing and the `:oneline` version will never be invoked.

Note that the symbols `:detail` or `:oneline` are just used in this document
to differentiate between the different printing versions.
They do not appear in any implementation, since this is not how printing works in julia.



## Some fallback functions

```julia
show_details(x) = show(stdout, "text/plain", x)

show_one_line(x) = show(stdout, x)

show_supercompact(x) = show(IOContext(stdout, :supercompact => true), x)
```

and also provide some macros

```
@show_details x
@show_one_line x
@show_super_compact x
```



### TODOs
 - Helper for `with 1 generator` and not `with 1 generators`
 - make indentation work by using stuff from https://github.com/KristofferC/IOIndents.jl
   the nested call will then be `print(indented(io), R.substruct)`
 - Max wants to add a few more examples so we can discuss them:
   - detailed group homomorphisms given by generator-images, including the mappings (`f1 -> (1,2)(3,4,5)`)
   - permutations
   - matrices (in detailed view they could print their ring?)
   - matrices-as-group-elements (should be distinguishable from plain matrices? at least in detailed mode)
 - Max: Right now all output starts with an uppercase letter. Drawback: this makes it harder to compose outputs.
   Perhaps we need an option to control that? Or we write a helper function
   which changes the case of the first letter of a string --
   but then we need to first print into strings, instead of directly printing to the output io,
   which means overhead and has other concerns
