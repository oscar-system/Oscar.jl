# Updating `CHANGELOG.md`

Before every release, `CHANGELOG.md` should be updated. Most of this is ideally
taken care by automation, provided PR labels were sensibly set. The following
labels explain which labels we use; how people who create or merge PRs should
set the labels; and how to perform the actual update.

## How we use pull request labels to organize the changelog

- TODO:
   - `release notes: XYZ` labels
   - `kind: ...`
   - `topic: ...`
   - `bug`, `enhancement`, ..

## Suggestions for categorizing pull requests

## Updating the changelog

- TODO: point to https://github.com/oscar-system/Oscar.jl/actions/workflows/changelog.yml
     and then select "Run workflow"; choose the branch (`master` X.Y.0 releases, and
     `release-X.y` for `X.Y.Z` patch releases)
- TODO: also point to `dev/releases/release_notes.py`
