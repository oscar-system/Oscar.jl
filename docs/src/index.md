# Welcome to Oscar

Oscar is a new computer algebra system. Oscar features functions for groups,
rings, and fields as well as linear and commutative algebra, number theory,
algebraic and polyhedral geometry, and more. It is built upon several well
established systems for mathematical research joined via the Julia programming
language. Have a look at our [Architecture](@ref) page for a detailed overview.
