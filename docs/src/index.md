# Welcome to OSCAR

## What is OSCAR?

OSCAR is a new computer algebra system. OSCAR features functions for groups,
rings, and fields as well as linear and commutative algebra, number theory,
algebraic and polyhedral geometry, and more. It is built upon several well
established systems for mathematical research joined via the Julia programming
language. Have a look at our [Architecture](@ref) page for a detailed overview
and at our [installation
instructions](https://www.oscar-system.org/install/) for installing OSCAR.


## How to reach us?

If you have questions about OSCAR, please have a look at our [Frequently Asked
Questions](@ref) and feel free to contact us under the channels mentioned on
[our community page](https://www.oscar-system.org/community/). Our main
communication channels are [Slack](https://oscar-system.org/slack)
and [Github](https://github.com/oscar-system/Oscar.jl).


## How to get started?

If you are eager to dive into OSCAR, our [tutorials](https://www.oscar-system.org/tutorials/)
are a great place to start. These tutorials provide hands-on introductions to various topics
in OSCAR. While they offer a glimpse into OSCAR's powerful features, they only scratch the surface.

For a deeper understanding, explore the detailed documentation you are reading now. Do not forget
to use the search field (top left corner) to quickly find information on the features you need.

We would love your feedback on our tutorials! Whether it is suggestions for improving existing
ones or ideas for new topics, your input helps us grow.
