# Welcome to OSCAR

## What is OSCAR?

OSCAR is a new *Open Source Computer Algebra Research* system. OSCAR features functions for groups,
rings, and fields as well as linear and commutative algebra, number theory,
algebraic and polyhedral geometry, and more. It is built upon several well
established systems for mathematical research joined via the Julia programming
language. Have a look at our [Architecture](@ref) page for a detailed overview
and at our [installation
instructions](https://www.oscar-system.org/install/) for installing OSCAR.


## How to reach us?

If you have questions about OSCAR, please have a look at our [Frequently Asked
Questions](@ref) and feel free to contact us under the channels mentioned on
