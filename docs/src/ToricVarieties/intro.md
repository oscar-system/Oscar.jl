# Introduction

The toric geometry part of OSCAR comprises algorithms addressing
- normal toric varieties
- torus-invariant divisors and line bundles on normal toric varieties
- objects from commutative algebra and polyhedral geometry derived thereof.


We follow [CLS11](@cite).
Our goal is to ensure that one can perform all computations of `Appendix B`.
Currently, this project is work-in-progress.
