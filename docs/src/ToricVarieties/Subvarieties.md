# Subvarieties

## Introduction

We focus on simplicial toric varieties. Then, any
closed subvariety is given as the vanishing set of
a homogeneous ideal in the Cox ring of the toric
variety in question (cf. proposition 5.2.4 in
[CLS11](@cite)). As of now, we provide elementary
support for closed subvarieties of simplicial toric
varieties.
