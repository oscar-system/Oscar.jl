Construction over concrete base may lead to singularity enhancement. Consider computing singular_loci. However, this may take time!

Global Tate model over a concrete base -- SU(5)xU(1) restricted Tate model based on arXiv paper 1109.3454 Eq. (3.1)

julia> t5 = resolve(t, 1)
Partially resolved global Tate model over a concrete base -- SU(5)xU(1) restricted Tate model based on arXiv paper 1109.3454 Eq. (3.1)
