Monomial basis of a highest weight module
  of highest weight [1, 1, 1, 1]
  of dimension 4096
  with monomial ordering wdegrevlex([x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, x10, x11, x12], [1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1])
over Lie algebra of type D4
  where the used birational sequence consists of the following roots (given as coefficients w.r.t. alpha_i):
    [0, 0, 0, 1]
    [0, 0, 1, 0]
    [0, 1, 1, 1]
    [0, 1, 1, 0]
    [0, 1, 0, 1]
    [0, 1, 0, 0]
    [1, 2, 1, 1]
    [1, 1, 1, 1]
    [1, 1, 0, 1]
    [1, 1, 1, 0]
    [1, 1, 0, 0]
    [1, 0, 0, 0]
  and the basis was generated by Minkowski sums of the bases of the following highest weight modules:
    [1, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 1, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 1, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 1]
    [0, 0, 1, 1]
