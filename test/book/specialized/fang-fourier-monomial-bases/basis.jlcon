julia> basis_lie_highest_weight(:A, 4, [2,1,2,1], [1,2,3,4,1,5,8,2,6,3]; monomial_ordering=:degrevlex)
Monomial basis of a highest weight module
  of highest weight [2, 1, 2, 1]
  of dimension 8750
  with monomial ordering degrevlex([x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, x10])
over Lie algebra of type A4
  where the used birational sequence consists of the following roots (given as coefficients w.r.t. alpha_i):
    [1, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 1, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 1, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 1]
    [1, 0, 0, 0]
    [1, 1, 0, 0]
    [1, 1, 1, 0]
    [0, 1, 0, 0]
    [0, 1, 1, 0]
    [0, 0, 1, 0]
  and the basis was generated by Minkowski sums of the bases of the following highest weight modules:
    [1, 0, 0, 0]
    [0, 1, 0, 0]
    [0, 0, 1, 0]
    [0, 0, 0, 1]
