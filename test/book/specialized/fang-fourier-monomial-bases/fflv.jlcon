julia> basis_lie_highest_weight_ffl(:A, 3, [1,1,1])
Monomial basis of a highest weight module
  of highest weight w_1 + w_2 + w_3
  of dimension 64
  with monomial ordering degrevlex([x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6])
over abstract Lie algebra of type A3 over QQ
where the used birational sequence consists of the following roots:
  [a_1 + a_2 + a_3, a_2 + a_3, a_1 + a_2, a_3, a_2, a_1]
