julia> basis_lie_highest_weight_string(:B, 3, [1,1,1], [3,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1])
Monomial basis of a highest weight module
  of highest weight w_1 + w_2 + w_3
  of dimension 512
  with monomial ordering neglex([x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9])
over abstract Lie algebra of type B3 over QQ
where the used birational sequence consists of the following roots:
  [a_3, a_2, a_3, a_2, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_2, a_1]
