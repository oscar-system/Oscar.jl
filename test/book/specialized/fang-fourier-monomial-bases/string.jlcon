julia> basis_lie_highest_weight_string(:B, 3, [1,1,1], [3,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1])
Monomial basis of a highest weight module
  of highest weight [1, 1, 1]
  of dimension 512
  with monomial ordering neglex([x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9])
over Lie algebra of type B3
  where the used birational sequence consists of the following roots (given as coefficients w.r.t. alpha_i):
    [0, 0, 1]
    [0, 1, 0]
    [0, 0, 1]
    [0, 1, 0]
    [1, 0, 0]
    [0, 1, 0]
    [0, 0, 1]
    [0, 1, 0]
    [1, 0, 0]
  and the basis was generated by Minkowski sums of the bases of the following highest weight modules:
    [1, 0, 0]
    [0, 1, 0]
    [0, 0, 1]
