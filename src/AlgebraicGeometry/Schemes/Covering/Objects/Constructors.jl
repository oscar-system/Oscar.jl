### The default constructor
# Returns a scheme in which every affine patch is only
# glued to itself via the identity.
@doc raw"""
    Covering(patches::Vector{<:AbsAffineScheme})

Return a `Covering` with pairwise disjoint affine charts ``Uáµ¢`` given by
the entries of `patches`. This `Covering` will have no gluings except
those gluings along the identity of every affine chart to itself.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> P1, (x,y) = QQ["x", "y"];

julia> P2, (u,v) = QQ["u", "v"];

julia> U1 = spec(P1);

julia> U2 = spec(P2);

julia> C = Covering([U1, U2]) # A Covering with two disjoint affine charts
Covering
  described by patches
    1: affine 2-space
    2: affine 2-space
  in the coordinate(s)
    1: [x, y]
    2: [u, v]
```

@doc raw"""
    disjoint_union(C1::Covering, C2::Covering)

Return the `Covering` corresponding to the disjoint union of `C1` and `C2`.

The charts and gluings of the disjoint union are given by the disjoint union of the charts and gluings of the covers `C1` and `C2`.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> P1, (x,y) = QQ["x", "y"];

julia> P2, (u,v) = QQ["u", "v"];

julia> U1 = spec(P1);

julia> U2 = spec(P2);
