# This type is needed to handle the morphisms in refinements of coverings efficiently. 
# In principal, it does not much more than `PrincipalOpenSubset` with it's implicit 
# embedding into its ambient scheme. But this allows for an actual morphism of rings 
# in the background, so that the identification of the domain with a principal open 
# subset of its codomain can also be realized for schemes with different `ambient_coordinate_ring`s. 
# This is important for the refinements, since we also allow `SimplifiedSpec`.
