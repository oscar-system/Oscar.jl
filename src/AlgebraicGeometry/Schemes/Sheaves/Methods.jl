### Lookup and production pattern for sheaves of modules
#
# When asked to produce a module on an open affine U, the functions
# below lead to the following behavior.
#
#                     U₁                    an `affine_chart` of `X`
#           _________/|\______________      (`patches` of `default_covering(X)`)
#          /          |               \
#          V₁         V₂______        |     two `PrincipalOpenSubset`s of U₁
#         /|\        /|\      \       |     covering the latter
#        / | \      / | \     |       |
#       W₁ W₂ W₃   A₁ A₂ A₃   C₁      D₁    `PrincipalOpenSubset`s of, respectively,
#                        |                  V₁, V₂, and U₁
#                        |
#                        E
#
#  Figure 1: A sample tree in one `affine_chart` of a `CoveredScheme`
#
#  Suppose the patches of the `default_covering` of ℱ (i.e. now the local variable
#  `default_cov`) are V₁ together with A₁, A₂, and A₃.
#
# 1) Look up whether U is in the list of patches of `default_cov`, e.g. U = V₁
#    or U = A₂. If yes, return the value of the dictionary.
#
# 2) See whether U hangs below some V in the ancestry tree with V
#    in `default_cov`; e.g. U = E or U = W₃. If yes, restrict from V.
#
# 3) Otherwise, U is covered by patches {Aᵢ}, i ∈ I, from `default_cov` and
#    contained in one affine chart U₁ of X
#      U₁ ⊃ U ⊃ Aᵢ.
#    We distinguish two sub-cases.
#
#    3.1) U appears in the refinement tree T of W whose leafs consist
#    entirely of the Aᵢs and the latter cover U. For instance, this
#    could be the case for U = V₂ with the Aᵢ covering it.
#    Let T' be the subtree starting from U and let {Aⱼ}, j ∈ J be the
#    leafs of this subtree. We then recursively build up the modules on
#    the nodes in T'. Note that this requires some further obvious
#    covering properties on the subtree T'.
#
#    3.2) U does not appear in the refinement tree T above; e.g.
#    when U = C₁ or U = D₁. Then we first have to build the module on
#    U₁ and restrict from there.
#
# The point 3) is not implemented, yet. Instead, the current code
# requires to take refinements hanging under nodes in `default_cov`.
