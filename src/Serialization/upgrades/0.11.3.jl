# Upgrade Summary
# Types of the form `Vector{T}` are only serialized with backref when
# `is_basic_serialization_type(T) == false`. If
# `is_basic_serialization_type(T) == true` the type `Vector{T}` does not
# serialize `T` in the entries, but instead as a part of the `Vector` serialization.
# Instances of the form `Tuple{T}` with `is_basic_serialization_type(T) == true` 
# are no longer serialized with backref, however these types were already storing
# there types outside of the JSON array of entries
