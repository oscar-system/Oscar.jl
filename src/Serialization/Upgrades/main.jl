# Upgrade scripts contain code to upgrade files that were serialized with an older
# format to the next file format version. Thus to upgrade a file to
# the latest format, one needs to apply all possible upgrade scripts in
# successive order as determined by their version until finally the file has
# been upgraded to the latest format.

# Warning: The object is not saved to the new format, that is left to the user

"""
    UpgradeScript(version::VersionNumber, script::Function)

Any upgrade scripts schould be created using the `UpgradeScript`
constructor and then pushed to the `upgrade_scripts_set`. The
name of the function is not particularly important however one
should be assigned so that it can be used for recursion if
necessary for upgrade. The upgrde script should be independent
from any Oscar code and should relie solely on `julia` core
functionality so to avoid conflicts with any future Oscar code
deprecations.

# Example
```
push!(upgrade_scripts_set, UpgradeScript(
  v"0.13.0",
  function upgrade_0_13_0(s::UpgradeState, dict::Dict)
      ...
  end
))
