    trace_lattice(L::Hecke.AbsLat{T}; order::Integer = 2) where T -> LatticeWithIsometry

Given a lattice `L` which is either a $\mathbb Z$-lattice or a hermitian lattice
over the $E/K$ with `E` a cyclotomic field and `K` a maximal real subfield of
`E`, return the trace lattice `Lf` whose underlying lattice is the trace lattice
of `L` and the underlying map `f` is:
  - the identity if `L` is a `ZLat` and `order == 1`;
  - the opposite of the identity if `L` is a `ZLat` and `order == 2`;
  - given by the multiplication by a $n$-th root of the unity if `L` is a
    `HermLat`, where `n` is the order a primitive element in `E`.

Note that the optional argument `order` has no effect if `L` is not a
$\mathbb Z$-lattice.
