    birkhoff_polytope(n::Integer, even::Bool = false)

Construct the Birkhoff polytope of dimension $n^2$.

This is the polytope of $n \times n$ stochastic matrices (encoded as row vectors of
length $n^2$), i.e., the matrices with non-negative real entries whose row and column
entries sum up to one. Its vertices are the permutation matrices.

Use `even = true` to get the vertices only for the even permutation matrices.

A polyhedron in ambient dimension 9

    pyramid(P::Polyhedron, z::Number = 1)

Make a pyramid over the given polyhedron `P`.

The pyramid is the convex hull of the input polyhedron `P` and a point `v`
outside the affine span of `P`. For bounded polyhedra, the projection of `v` to
the affine span of `P` coincides with the vertex barycenter of `P`. The scalar `z`
is the distance between the vertex barycenter and `v`.

    bipyramid(P::Polyhedron, z::Number = 1, z_prime::Number = -z)
